But millions of general election voters -- and even some GOP donors -- are just tuning in to Trump's high self-regard and proclivity for misstatements.\n\u201cOkay, so our guy is insane,\u201d said one GOP fundraising bundler privately after getting his first up-close view of his party\u2019s presidential nominee at a recent California fundraiser.\nTrump so loved the adulation of attendees that he insisted on taking photos with everyone there, rather than just those who\u2019d donated the threshold amount. Trump blew his schedule for the day as a result.\nTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post's queries on the topic.\nAs it happens, some mental health professionals have been pondering Trump\u2019s state of mind for months, and appear to have arrived at a consensus. From his exaggerated claims of immense wealth and his aggressive insults against those who challenge him, to his expectation that all Republicans should fall in line to support him, Trump exhibits symptoms of what the American Psychiatric Association defines as narcissistic personality disorder.\u00a0\n\u201cThe boldness, the risk-taking, the attention-seeking, are classic narcissistic traits,\u201d said W. Keith Campbell, a University of Georgia psychology professor and co-author of The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement.\nThe only real question: whether Trump merely possesses many of the traits, or if his condition warrants the full-on label of \u201cdisorder.\"\n\u201cI don\u2019t like throwing out the term\" narcissistic personality disorder, Campbell said. \u201cThat\u2019s a clinical diagnosis.\u201d\nNone of the experts contacted by The Huffington Post was willing to offer a diagnosis for Trump. That may be because it's difficult to diagnose anyone without a personal examination -- or it may be a result of the 1964 presidential election, when a number of psychiatrists responding to a magazine survey said Republican Barry Goldwater was unfit to be president. Goldwater lost the election in a landslide, but won his libel suit against the magazine.\nIn any case, said Columbia University psychiatry professor Robert Klitzman, the severity of the condition is a matter of degree, with the disorder diagnosis reserved for those whose symptoms are so severe that they affect the person\u2019s ability to function.\n\u201cHe managed to mount a national campaign to get millions of people to vote for him,\u201d Klitzman said of Trump. \u201cIt's hard to say that someone in that position has a disorder.\"\nWhatever the severity of his condition, many of Trump's actions and statements through the years that may have appeared bizarre on their face make more sense in the context of the symptoms:\n\nClaiming wealth exceeding $10 billion, when every independent estimate has been at most half of that? \u201cExaggerating your achievements and talents,\u201d is trait No. 3 among the dozen listed on the Mayo Clinic\u2019s description of the disorder.\nBelieving the Republican National Committee and its donors should handle all the fundraising and voter turnout details for his general election campaign? Here\u2019s trait No. 8: \u201cExpecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectations.\u201d\nPretending to be a publicist to plant the false story that he was dating Italian supermodel Carla Bruni? Trait No. 4: \u201cBeing preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate.\u201d\n\nEven Trump\u2019s months-long feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly over her tough questioning at a GOP debate last summer may fit the disorder\u2019s characteristics. A Kent State University study published in 2010 showed that narcissistic men were far more prone to harbor hostile attitudes toward women -- because women held the power to harm their self-esteem.\nSome narcissistic traits, the researchers pointed out, are not necessarily a bad thing in presidential candidates.\n\u201cThey can be helpful in getting people to believe in you, in getting out there and working hard, in getting your agenda through,\u201d Columbia\u2019s Klitzman said, adding that past presidents like Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson all exhibited narcissistic traits, but managed to function effectively in office.\n\u201cAnyone running for president either has a high level of narcissism or is being funded by someone with a high level of narcissism,\u201d said Campbell, who wondered whether Trump\u2019s actions truly reflect his personality or are part of \u201chis shtick.\u201dOne element Campbell said he does not understand, however, is Trump\u2019s propensity for misstatements, particularly those that are easily refuted and don\u2019t necessarily advance his image.\n\u201cI think people who are narcissist can be dishonest, but a lot of that dishonesty is in the service of themselves,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWhy, when there's no upside, do you lie at all? Unless that's just your default position.\u201d\nThat, more than the self-regard, is what unnerves the GOP bundler, who said he sees it as undermining his ability to tell donors what Trump would do if elected. \u201cLying for the sake of lying. You've got to watch out for those guys,\u201d he said.\nIn any event, whether Trump\u2019s narcissism is an actual clinical disorder, or not quite that severe, is probably a distinction without a difference, at least for American voters. At 70 years of age, Trump is unlikely to change --\u00a0and change is only possible if Trump desires it.\n\u201cWhen you have narcissistic personality disorder, you may not want to think that anything could be wrong -- doing so wouldn't fit with your self-image of power and perfection,\u201d the Mayo Clinic narcissism web page says. \u201cPeople with narcissistic personality disorder are most likely to seek treatment when they develop symptoms of depression --\u00a0often because of perceived criticisms or rejections.\u201d\nEditor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "The Fundamental Question About Trump: What's Wrong With This Guy?"}
