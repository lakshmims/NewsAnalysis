The riots themselves took place in the early morning hours of June 28, less than 24 hours after Garland's funeral and memorial services were held in Manhattan.\u00a0\n\"My mother would have loved the fact that people fought back, because she hated bigotry, and she hated injustice,\" Luft told the crowd. \"And don't ask how much she would've loved that rainbow flag!\"\u00a0\nEarlier this week, Luft visited the Stonewall Inn, located in New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood, where a memorial to the 49 victims of the Orlando shooting had been erected. Actor-playwright Harvey Fierstein shared a snapshot of Luft kneeling beside the makeshift shrine on his official Facebook page.\u00a0According to Luft, it was her first-ever visit to the historic venue, where she was photographed with other members of the New York theater community for a Playbill feature commemorating LGBT Pride. That experience, she said, was \"so emotional.\"\u00a0\n\"To realize what happened, and to meet the owner [Kurt Kelly], and for him to say, 'This is where history was made' -- that was fascinating to me,\" Luft told The Huffington Post. These days, she sees the fact that Stonewall is so intertwined with her mother's legacy as an honor to her family. She said she felt particularly proud when Stonewall staff told her, \"Your mom's memory is here, so we always talk to her. When something goes wrong, we say, 'Judy doesn't want that to happen.'\"\u00a0\nThe fact that her three New York concerts, which feature music by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Irving Berlin, Peter Allen and others,\u00a0coincide with a Pride week that feels especially poignant in the wake of the Orlando tragedy\u00a0isn't lost on Luft.\u00a0\n\"This past week, we've all been tested,\" she told HuffPost. \"We've been tested with our hearts hurting. We've been tested with our minds asking, 'Why?' I think that it's so important to celebrate for the people who are not [here], and to say, 'We will walk forward,' and that we're all equal.\"\u00a0\n\"Lorna Luft Celebrates Pride Week\" plays New York's Feinstein's/54 Below through June 25.
