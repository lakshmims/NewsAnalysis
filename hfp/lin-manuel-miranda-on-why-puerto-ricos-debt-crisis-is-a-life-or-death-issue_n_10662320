The two sat down in front of a live audience to discuss inclusivity in the arts, diversity on Broadway and a\u00a0particularly personal issue for Miranda: the Puerto Rican debt crisis.\u00a0\n\"I have a lot of family who are struggling in Puerto Rico, that\u2019s not an abstract issue to me, that is a life or death issue occurring with my family,\" he said, before taking a minute to concretize the issue for Rodin and the audience:\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a million reasons Puerto Rico is in the state it\u2019s in. A lot of it comes out of this uncertain [question], \"What are we to the United States?\" It\u2019s become a tax haven. There\u2019s been a lot of problems.\nWhat we\u2019re trying to do now is allow them to restructure their debt because that was a thing they use to be able to do and then for some reason in 1984, when someone threw it into a bill, they couldn\u2019t anymore. They couldn\u2019t do what any American city can do, which is declare bankruptcy and restructure debt. And this July 1 deadline is very real. [The bill is currently] in the Senate, I would hate to see people play politics with it to the point where this thing can\u2019t pass.\n\nBut while Miranda understands the pressing need to pass the bill currently being reviewed by Congress, he hasn't been shy about pointing out its flaws.\u00a0The star wrote an op-ed in New York's El Diario/La Prensa newspaper in May on the topic, and he echoed its contents during his recent conversation with Rodin.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\"The [bill]\u00a0on the [Senate] floor is not perfect,\" Miranda said. \"It calls for austerity from an island that can afford no more austerity. It calls for the lowering of the minimum wage to 4.25 dollars an hour, which is what I made at McDonald\u2019s in 1993. It is not a livable wage in 2016. So it\u2019s not perfect, but it does allow for debt restructuring and it does protect pensions on the island, which is a huge problem. So it\u2019s in the Senate\u2019s hands.\"\nAnother key issue for Miranda this year will be the Latino vote, in a recent interview with the The New York Times the star said\u00a0he'd dedicate some time to encouraging Latinos cast their ballot\u00a0in this election after his final \"Hamilton\" curtain call on July 9. And he explained to Rodin why it's so important for people to take the Latino vote seriously.\u00a0\n\"I remember, in 2008, pundits literally saying \u2018Well, there\u2019s a lot of Latinos right now, but maybe they\u2019ll stay home,\u2019 and they didn\u2019t stay home. [Then]\u00a02012 came around, 'Maybe they\u2019ll stay home this time' and they didn\u2019t stay home,\" he said. \"The reality is the demographics are such that Latinos are going to be one of the largest groups in this country...so it is just vital that our voting reflects who we are and our populous, we have to make sure our voices are heard on every issue.\"\nBut Miranda's efforts to get Latinos to vote aren't necessarily aligned with a particular political party, he said he simply wants Latinos to flex their political muscle.\u00a0\n\"We\u2019re not a monolith, there are Hispanic democrats and there are Hispanic republicans, but we\u2019re not going to know what that power is unless people show up,\" he said. \"So that\u2019s why it\u2019s a priority for me\u2026 the power of us as a voting bloc is still there and waiting to be tapped. I want to see us come out in record numbers, and I want to see what that does for our country.\"\nThe Huffington Post is a media partner with The Rockefeller Foundation on the \"Insight Dialogues\" series.", "title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda On Why Puerto Rico's Debt Crisis Is A \u2018Life Or Death Issue\u2019"}
