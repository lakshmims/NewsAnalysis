Bush, perhaps the most powerful person to ever publicly declare how much he hated broccoli, got a letter from a 5-year-old extolling the virtues of the vegetable.\nThe 41st president tweeted a picture he had received from a youngster named Cooper, who had eaten broccoli the previous evening and wanted Bush to know how much he liked it.\n\"My grama [sic] told me that you do not like broccoli and never want it served. I just want you to know that I love broccoli,\" Cooper wrote. \"Mr. President, broccoli is really good for you. I wish you liked broccoli like I do.\"\nThe 92-year old Bush didn't seem like he was changing his stance on the vegetable, tweeting that Cooper's love for broccoli was \"genuine, if also unpersuasive.\u00a0As president, Bush reportedly did not want broccoli served on Air Force One.\n\"I do not like broccoli,\" he said in 1990. \"And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it. And I'm President of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli!''", "title": "George H.W. Bush Is Unpersuaded By 5-Year-Old's Case For Broccoli"}
