Remember, nothing says \"Don't mess with me\" like bringing the Needle to the negotiating table, Arya.\u00a0\nTo put it in perspective, Ellen Pompeo, the star of another long-running TV drama, \"Grey's Anatomy,\" is reportedly earning upward of\u00a0$300,000 per episode. And she's survived a plane crash,\u00a0removed a live bomb from a patient\u2019s body, gave birth during a power outage, and almost drowned in the Pacific. But who's counting?\u00a0\nSeason 7 will reportedly have a shortened order of only seven episodes, which means that the leads will each rake in a cool $3.5 million over the course of the season.\u00a0The salary increase is set to make the five \"Game of Thrones\" leads some of the highest-paid actors in the cable TV game.\u00a0", "title": "'Game Of Thrones' Cast To Make All The Westerosi Coin In Final Seasons"}
