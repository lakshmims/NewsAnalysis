Rapoport does it right and -- we're willing to bet --\u00a0is one of best dressed in the building.Rapoport took over as editor and changed Bon App\u00e9tit's style in 2010\u00a0to modernize it, at a time when the pressure was on. The magazine had the second-largest circulation at Cond\u00e9 then, and still does, by the way.\nSo it seems that Rapoport's editorial style, much like his sartorial style, is a success.To celebrate Father's Day, we asked Rapoport what he learned about style from his dad, the late publisher, author and Washington journalist, Dan Rapoport, pictured above.\nHere's what he said:\n\n\"My dad taught me to always be a nice guy, ask lots of questions and never pay more than $400 for a suit. Let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve managed to do pretty well with two of the three.\"\n", "title": "What Bon Appetit's Editor-In-Chief Learned From His Dad About Style"}
