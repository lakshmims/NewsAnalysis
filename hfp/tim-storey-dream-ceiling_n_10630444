While two people can have extraordinary different lives, life coach and self-help author Tim Storey believes no one should feel limited by the level of expectation that surrounds them.\nThroughout childhood, Storey says we all have a ceiling put on our dreams. When the motivational speaker visits schools in \"tougher\" neighborhoods, for example, he says the ceiling is often low. \"Don't get pregnant\" or \"don't be thrown in jail\" is the expectation.\nKids in other neighborhoods, however, are given a higher ceiling. \"If I go to other friends of mine, they're like, \"Oh my gosh, did you know that Courtney went to Yale? Did you know that Kirsten is in Oxford?'\" he quips.\nStorey says to think back and ask yourself, \"What was the ceiling of your life growing up?\" Think about what your parents told you, what your aunt talked about, what your teachers said to you. \"Because that has a lot to do with what you feel you can accomplish,\" he says.\nNo matter what limiting rhetoric you may have been told, here's the kicker that Storey wants you to remember: \"I believe that an utmost God does not create almost children,\" he says.\nMore from life coach Tim Storey: Why some people are always stuck in a setback", "title": "Here's An Interesting Theory About Why You May Not Be Reaching Your Full Potential"}
