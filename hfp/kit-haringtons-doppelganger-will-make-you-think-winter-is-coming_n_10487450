The lucky fellow shares Harington's flowing locks, occasionally brooding stare and even his facial hair (before the actor shaved off his beard for a new role).\u00a0\nIn an email correspondence with the Huffington Post, Harington's lookalike told us that his name is Josiah Martin. Just 24-years-old, Martin was born and raised in Indiana, though he is currently relocating to Finland with his wife.\u00a0\n\"The second I began to grow my hair out people called me Jon Snow,\" Martin told HuffPost. \"It worked out perfectly because my wife's only celebrity crush is Kit Harington.\"\u00a0Martin said that he didn't begin watching \"Game of Thrones\" until people noted his resemblance to one of the main characters, but after a little binge watching -- he's hooked.\u00a0\nWhile he's a little confused about his newfound viral fame, Martin hopes that Harington finds the lookalike situation hilarious.\u00a0\n\"Who knows, maybe Kit will find it amusing and we can do a kick-ass comedy/action team up,\" Martin said. \"I'm thinking maybe a remake of 'Twins' or some remake of the old Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen films?\"\u00a0\nSounds like a hit!On Instagram, Martin also pointed that he once resembled another famous actor, Seth Rogen.\u00a0Of course, now that Harington's shaved his beard and looks somewhat like a goth teenager, Martin may be mistaken for Jon Snow more than the actor himself!", "title": "Kit Harington's Doppelg\u00e4nger Will Make You Think Winter Is Coming"}
