Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action. \"The NRA believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period. Anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing. If an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement, the government should be allowed to immediately go to court, block the sale, and arrest the terrorist. At the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed.\"\u00a0HuffPost's Cristian Farias wrote about why the NRA has a point\u00a0about due process:\n\n[T]o understand its argument, one must look beyond the Second Amendment the group loves so dear to another part of the Constitution:\u00a0the one that guarantees due process of law for anyone whose rights the government intends to target.\nOn this front, the NRA has forcefully and successfully argued government watch lists are constitutionally problematic because they\u2019re bloated and sweep far too broadly, ensnaring innocent Americans that otherwise pose no threat to national security \u2014 including one prominent U.S. senator, media pundits, executives, even\u00a0babies\u00a0and the late\u00a0Nelson Mandela.\u00a0\nWhen anti-gun furor following the Paris terrorist attacks reached fever pitch last year, the NRA pointed to our own coverage here in The Huffington Post to underscore the myriad problems with terror watch lists, and sought to dispel the public misperception that the organization was somehow interested in arming homegrown jihadists.\n\nThe debate over whether people on a terror watch list should be able to purchase guns was revived after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, on Sunday, that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The shooter, 29-year-old\u00a0Omar Mateen, had been scrutinized by the FBI multiple times and placed on a watch list.\nThis story has been updated to include a response from the NRA.\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Sides With Democrats Over NRA In Gun Ban Debate"}
