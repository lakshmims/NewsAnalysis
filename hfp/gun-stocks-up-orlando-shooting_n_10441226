CEO Michael Fifer noted a \"significant spike in demand\" that \"was strongly correlated to the tragic, terrorist events in Paris and San Bernardino.\"\nA shooting early last December at a social services center in San Bernardino, California,\u00a0left 14 dead and 21 wounded. A month earlier, terrorists in Paris killed 130 people and injured hundreds in coordinated attacks.\n\"[In the past decade] there have been some significant ups and downs in demand, as political rhetoric and threats have spurred demand above the underlying normal rate of demand,\" Fifer wrote. \"These spikes in demand have been followed by periods when demand retreated as the threats to gun rights failed to materialize to the degree that caused the spike in the first place.\"\nTrue to form, in trading Monday, Sturm, Ruger & Co. was up 8.6 percent:Smith &\u00a0Wesson also jumped in early trading, opening up 10 percent before relinquishing some of the gains as the day continued:\"The No. 1 driver of firearms sales is fear,\"\u00a0Brian Ruttenbur, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, told Bloomberg in December, after the San Bernardino shooting.\u00a0\u201cPrimarily, fear of registration restrictions, banning and things like that.\u201d\nRuttenbur added that people may also fear for their personal safety.\nApparently that fear has become a dominant force.\u00a0There are more guns in America than there are Americans.", "title": "Gun Stocks Are Up Sharply.
