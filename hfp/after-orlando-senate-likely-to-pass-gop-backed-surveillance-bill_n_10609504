The proposal met opposition from critics who said it threatened civil liberties and did little to improve national security.\nThe bill, which the Obama administration has sought for years, \u201cwill allow the FBI to collect the dots so they can connect the dots, and that\u2019s been the biggest problem that they\u2019ve had in identifying these homegrown, radicalized terrorists,\u2019\u201d Senator John Cornyn, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said Tuesday.\nThe vote also represents a bi-partisan drift away from policy positions that favored digital privacy, which had taken hold in the three years since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed the breadth of government surveillance programs.\nThe post-Snowden moves included the most substantial reforms to the U.S. intelligence community since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and a refusal to heed the FBI\u2019s call for laws that would undermine encryption.\nIt is unclear if the House would pass the Senate proposal, given its alliance between libertarian-leaning Republicans and tech-friendly Democrats that has blocked past efforts to expand surveillance.\nThe legislation before the Senate Wednesday, filed as an amendment to a criminal justice funding bill, would widen the FBI\u2019s authority to use so-called National Security Letters, which do not require a warrant and whose very existence is usually a secret.\nSuch letters can currently compel a company to hand over a user's phone billing records. Under the Senate's change they could demand electronic communications transaction records such as time stamps of emails and the emails' senders and recipients, in addition to some information about websites a person visits.\nThe legislation would also make permanent a provision of the USA Patriot Act that allows the intelligence community to conduct surveillance on \u201clone wolf\u201d suspects who do not have confirmed ties to a foreign terrorist group. That provision, which the Justice Department said last year had never been used, is currently set to expire in December 2019.\n'KNEE-JERK SOLUTIONS\u2019\nPrivacy groups and civil liberties advocates accused Republicans this week of exploiting the Orlando shooting to build support for unrelated legislation.\nSenator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, criticized Senate Republicans for \u201cpushing fake, knee-jerk solutions that will do nothing to prevent mass shootings or terrorist attacks.\u201d\nThough Republicans invoked the Orlando shooting in support of the bill, FBI Director James Comey has said Mateen\u2019s transactional records were fully reviewed by authorities who investigated him twice for possible extremist ties.\nComey said there was \u201cno indication\u201d Mateen belonged to any extremist group and that it was unlikely authorities could have done anything differently to prevent the attack.", "title": "After Orlando, Senate Likely To Pass GOP-Backed Surveillance Bill"}
