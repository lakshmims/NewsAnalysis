But perhaps any question to the global superstar could be a mine field at this point.\nPortugal is winless and Ronaldo is scoreless in the tournament, having missed a penalty kick\u00a0in a 0-0 tie against Austria. That followed a draw to Iceland, after which Ronaldo sniffed, \"It was a lucky night for them.\"\nTorres told the BBC that Ronaldo's reaction was not personal. \"We produce a lot of news about him,\" Torres said. \"Some of it he doesn't like. Perhaps that's why he did it. But it wasn't a personal thing.\"\nA victory by\u00a0Portugal over Hungary\u00a0would guarantee Ronaldo and his teammates a spot in the round of 16. Hang on to your microphones, reporters.", "title": "Cristiano Ronaldo Throws Reporter's Mic Into Lake, Finally Makes A Shot"}
