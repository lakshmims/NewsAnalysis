That\u2019s both terrifying and unsurprising -- gun sales often skyrocket\u00a0after mass shootings.\nBut the ease with which we purchased our AR-15, a Vietnam-era gun hailed by the military as being the perfect killing machine, was surreal. This, despite the fact that Florida Gov. Rick Scott had declared a state of emergency in Orange County, which includes Orlando.\nOn any given day, regardless of whether your town has endured a horrific tragedy, it\u2019s not hard to purchase a weapon of mass murder like we did in most of America.\u00a0A reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News was able to get one in just seven minutes in Pennsylvania on Monday.\nWithin seconds, we had it in our hands: A rifle that weighs less than a small watermelon and can, like the MCX Sig Sauer that Mateen used, easily fire several dozen rounds in less than 10 seconds. Our Diamondback DB15's killing power is striking, and at $644, it\u2019s a relatively affordable murder weapon.Gun shop employees were happy to discuss lethality. When another customer looking to purchase a small, .22-caliber handgun noted that it wouldn\u2019t fare well against a \u201c6-foot-3, 350 pound man,\u201d the employee agreed.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to hit him in the neck or the heart,\u201d said the employee, whom we aren\u2019t naming for this story.\nHe went on to joke with the customer that he should either pick a bigger gun or use the .22 to \u201cshoot him in the stomach 15 times, that\u2019d really piss him off.\u201d\nBehind him, the TV blared Fox News coverage of the massacre at Pulse nightclub, located nearby. On the wall, a framed photo of President Barack Obama with the caption, \u201cFirearm Salesman Of The Year,\u201d hung next to an array of other long rifles, some of them higher caliber than the AR-15, and some of them more affordable, too.\nSemi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 have been used in several of the most deadly shooting rampages in the United States in recent years, even before the attack in Orlando. The killers behind the mass shootings in San Bernardino, California, the elementary school at Newtown, Connecticut, and the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, all used AR-15s.They\u2019re not the cheapest rifles around -- another, higher-caliber carbine hung on the wall at our shop for half the price. But the National Rifle Association calls the AR-15 the most popular weapon in the U.S. \"It is\u00a0customizable, adaptable, reliable and accurate,\" the organization says on its blog.\nShop workers told us we\u2019d have to wait if we wanted to buy a smaller gun. There\u2019s a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases in Florida, but that rule does not apply to rifles.\nThe employee made some small talk, declaring that all guns fall under one of three classifications: Leisure, defense and hunting. We aren\u2019t sure which category Mateen\u2019s gun falls under. \nUnder any of the gun shop employee\u2019s definitions, there seems no reason for a weapon that can fire 10 or more bullets in quick succession. The AR-15 and its close cousins are not made to hunt deer. They\u2019re made to kill people.\nAll it took to attain one was a driver\u2019s license (the one we used was from out of state) and a few minutes to wait for the background check to clear. We signed state-issued proof of sale documents that asked whether we were felons or drug addicts, and where we lived.\nWaiting for the background check was the hardest part -- and that only involved a few minutes of idle time. We requested data from the state Department of Law Enforcement on the current volume of background checks for similar guns, but did not get an immediate response. The department has been overwhelmed by public records requests since the shooting, a spokeswoman said. \nNothing that we or the store employees did was illegal or unusual. You can buy semi-automatic rifles at several stores in the Orlando area.\nAs of this writing, we have the same firepower that Mateen had when he opened fire at one of Orlando\u2019s most famous gay clubs. We don\u2019t have any ammunition, though -- the shop ran out of .223-caliber rounds.\nWe plan to return the gun. Eventually, it will join countless other rifles of its kind on the legal, Great American gun market.\nUPDATE: 6/15 -- We attempted to return the AR-15 to the shop where we purchased it. Despite having a return policy, they refused. So we opted to turn the gun over to Orlando police, who said they would have it destroyed.Read More:\u00a0\n\nWhat We Know About The Orlando Shooting Victims\nHow ISIS Used The Orlando Shooting To Feed Its Propaganda Machine\nWATCH: 360-View Of New York's Vigil To Honor Those Lost In Orlando\nAfshine Emrani: Your Reaction To Muslims Will Define You, Not Islam\nWhat You Need To Know About The Weapons Of War Used In Mass Shootings\nDoctors Condemn The NRA-Fueled Ban On Gun Violence Research\n", "title": "It Took Us Just 38 Minutes To Buy An AR-15 In Orlando"}
