Noticing Gonzal\u2019s unique talent, Tenet asked him if he could mechanize one of his old prosthetics he had lying around the house and thus, the partnership was born.\nAt the moment Tenet uses his shoulder to move the prosthetic gun, which both artists insist is a prototype, or \"kinetic sculpture,\" and is not practical for everyday use yet. But Tenet told Motherboard that he hopes in the future he\u2019ll be able to incorporate wrist and finger movements while using the prosthetic.\nIn regards to how Tenet felt using the prosthetic for the first time, he told Mashable:\u00a0\"I had to relearn to use my right hand 22 years after the loss; it's terrifying and amazing at the same time.\u201d", "title": "Artist With One Arm Inks Clients With Tattoo Gun Prosthetic"}
