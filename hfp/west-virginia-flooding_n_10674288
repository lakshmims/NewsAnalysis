Ohio and Jackson counties also reported one death each.\nThe death toll in West Virginia is the highest in any state from flooding this year. At least 16 people, including nine U.S. soldiers, were killed in flooding in Texas earlier in June.Up to 10 inches (25.4 cm) of rain fell on Thursday in the mountainous state, sending torrents of water from rivers and streams through homes and causing widespread devastation.\nTomblin has declared a state of emergency in 44 of 55 counties and expects 400 members of theWest Virginia National Guard to help rescue efforts on Saturday. About 32,000 homes and businesses remained without power on Saturday.\nHundreds of people have been rescued and search and rescue teams were looking for more people on Saturday, said Tim Rock, spokesman for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.\nSome towns were completely surrounded by water and hundreds of houses and buildings have been lost, Rock said.The Greenbrier resort was closed indefinitely and PGA Tour officials said on Saturday the Greenbrier Classic golf tournament due to begin on July 7 had been canceled because of extensive flood damage.\nWest Virginia received one-quarter of its annual rainfall in a single day and multiple rivers surged to dangerous levels, including the Elk River, which broke a record at one stage that had stood since 1888.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n(Reporting by David Bailey in Minneapolis and Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Editing by David Gregorio and Tom Brown)", "title": "West Virginia Flooding Kills 24 And Submerges Towns"}
