Dr. Betty Deas Clark of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina,\u00a0is well-acquainted with that anguish.\u00a0\nAs the new pastor of the historically black church, Clark still mourns the men and women she knew who were shot and killed during a monstrous massacre there last year.\u00a0This Friday, June 17th, marks one year since that dreadful day when bullets, shot by self-declared white supremacist Dylann Roof, who later confessed to the crime, claimed the lives of nine black men and women who gathered for bible study.\u00a0\nNow, as Clark copes with the sorrow the commemoration brings, she also mourns those killed in Orlando. She traveled to Florida earlier this week to extend prayer and peace to those suffering from Sunday\u2019s shooting.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m here to share, with those here in Orlando, the love that the world shared to us and is still sharing with us,\u201d Clark told The Huffington Post over the phone when she visited the city on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s like [something] I once saw on TV that said: \u2018Life, pass it on.\u2019 Well for me, it\u2019s joy, it\u2019s hope, it\u2019s gratitude, it\u2019s love. Pass it on.\u201dClark\u2019s compassion is something she admitted has grown since she began preaching at Emanuel AME, commonly known as Mother Emanuel, in January. Her relatively new role, which made her the church's first female pastor, has helped to identify her as a leader for both a community and a congregation that have experienced many emotions since the massacre rocked Charleston and other cities around the world.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s all been a whirlwind,\u201d Clark said of her experience as pastor at Mother Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s been filled with moments of joy, moments of sadness, and it\u2019s stretched me as a leader. I guess I\u2019m more compassionate now than I\u2019ve ever been before.\u201d\nTo mark the one-year anniversary, Clark and the rest of the Charleston community will hold a 12-day commemoration to honor those slain. As part of that string of services,\u00a0Clark will deliver a special memorial sermon on Friday as she stands in a pulpit that was formerly reserved for Rev. Clementa Pinckney -- a well-admired state senator in South Carolina who was one of the victims tragically shot and killed during Roof's racially-motivated act of terrorism.\nClark said she personally knew Pinckney, as well as some of the eight other men and women who died that day.\u00a0Their names were: Tywanza Sanders, Cynthia Hurd, Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Rev. Daniel Simmons, Rev. DePayne Middleton-Doctor and Susie Jackson.\n\u201cOddly enough, about a week before he died, [Pinckney] and I had a very extensive conversation,\u201d Clark said. She recalled how the two met just a week before he died to plan for an annual conference in South Carolina. \u201cOur bishop was retiring and we wanted his last series of conferences to be his best. We did everything we possibly could to compare notes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, two days after he was massacred, we were to talk again and continue to share notes,\u201d she added.\u00a0Pinckney and Clark shared much in common. Prior to moving over to Mother Emanuel, Clark was a pastor at another historical black church just two hours away in Sumpter, South Carolina. She expressed deep praise for Pickney and she said she'll never forget the lessons on life and leadership that he instilled in her.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to continue what he and I talked about: Doing the best at all times,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so everything I do, every sermon I preach, every appointment I accept, I give it my best.\u201d\u00a0\nThrough her preaching and spirit of forgiveness, Clark said she hopes she has been able to bring some sense of comfort and calm to those who seek her guidance, especially churchgoers who frequent Mother Emanuel.\u00a0\n\u201cThe congregation as a whole, we\u2019ve bonded in many ways. We\u2019ve grown,\u201d Clark said of how church members have coped with the tragedy. \u201cThe congregation is very resilient. Yes, we do grieve, yes, we do cry, but yes, we do laugh as well.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe community has stood with us and we\u2019re standing with the community and we\u2019re all growing together,\u201d she added.\u00a0\u00a0As part of that growth, Clark has made a stronger commitment to use the church as a venue to host discussions on important topics effecting the community, such as the effects of racial gun violence and ways America can better achieve racial unity. Recently, she said the church hosted a screening of an episode from the \"Roots\"\u00a0remake, which was followed by a panel discussion that explored racial issues both past and present.\u00a0\nClark, along with her other efforts, has also helped to create a series of sermons titled \u201cVoices of the Valley,\u201d which will conclude on Friday the 24th with an event that she said will allow for community members to openly mourn those killed in the church massacre. She hopes the steps the church is taking will help to create a healthier, ongoing dialogue around race in America. \u00a0\u201cThat helps us not just as a black race, not just as a white race, but as a human race, that we can talk and discuss and find ways to learn to live together, learn to love each other and yet respect that diversity,\u201d she said. \u201cRacial unity is important not just because I happen to serve as pastor but because I am a citizen of the world. I think the world needs to...figure out where we are and where we need to go -- and collectively, we need to go there.\u201d\u00a0\nClark credits her courage and resilience to\u00a0\"God\u2019s amazing grace.\"\n\"I have no idea how things are done,\" she said. \"But I just know that every day, He guides me, He leads me, and we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d\u00a0\nAs we mark the one year-anniversary of the Charleston massacre, and continue to mourn those killed in Orlando, it's important we never forget the innocent and beautiful lives America has lost to gun violence and calculated acts of bigotry and hate.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to say to the world, thank you for loving us, thank you for caring for us, and caring about us,\u201d Rev. Clark said of the support she, the congregation and the community have received from millions around the world. \u201cThank you for never forgetting us.\u201d\u00a0", "title": "Mother Emanuel\u2019s New Pastor On Charleston Massacre One Year Later"}
