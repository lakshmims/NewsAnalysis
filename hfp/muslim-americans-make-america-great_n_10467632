His father Seddique Mateen, an amateur YouTube star with eccentric political views who\u00a0made a homophobic statement in an interview about his son's actions, said whatever motivated his son had \u201cnothing to do with religion.\u201d\n\u201cThe United States is the house that is always taking care of me, my family, all the people from my homeland,\u201d he told reporters on Monday.\nHad Trump been American president rather than an emerging celebrity and real-estate developer in the 1980s, and able to ban Seddique Mateen and millions of other Muslims from the U.S., America wouldn\u2019t be America.\u00a0Had Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban been in place then, here are just some of the Muslims who would have never come to the U.S. and made America great.\n\u00a0\nMohammad Salman HamdaniOn Sept. 11, 2001, Hamdani, a 23-year-old police cadet and volunteer emergency medical technician who was applying to medical school, was heading out on a date when he noticed the Twin Towers burning, and rushed to the scene to provide medical assistance, according to what his family and friends later pieced together.\nHamdani\u2019s body was later found among the wreckage of the north tower. At his funeral, then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the Muslim cadet \u201can example of how one can make the world better.\u201d\nHamdani\u2019s Pakistani parents brought him to New York as a baby in 1979. \u201cAnybody who is born in this earth in America, it is like [being] born in heaven,\" his father Saleem told reporters.\nAhmed Zewail Zewail won the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1999 for helping to develop a new scientific field -- femtochemistry. \u00a0His work made it possible to observe the movement of atoms in a femtosecond -- a millionth of a billionth of a second.\n\"By inventing these methods Zewail was the Christopher Columbus of the femtoworld, becoming the first to witness chemical events that occurred in quadrillionths of a second,\u201d science historian Robert Paradowski wrote.\nThe son of an Egyptian motorbike mechanic, Zewail came to the U.S. to pursue his scientific ambitions and became a U.S. citizen in the early 1980s. His native Egypt was so proud of his work it issued two postage stamps in his honor.\nIn 2009, Zewail was appointed to a group of America\u2019s leading scientists who act as presidential advisors. Zewail is \u201cwidely respected not only for his science but also for his efforts in the Middle East as a voice of reason,\u201d the announcement from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology reads.\n\"I don't know all the reasons for these achievements, but I know that I love what I do and I have never wanted to rest on my laurels,\" Zewail wrote in his 2003 autobiography.\n\u00a0Rima FakihIn 2010, Fakih, then 24 years old, was crowned Miss USA. The national beauty pageant was owned at the time by Trump.\nFakih\u2019s Shia Muslim family moved to the U.S. from Lebanon in the early 1990s in the wake of the nation\u2019s civil war. She was raised in New York before moving to Michigan. \n\"I'd like to say I'm American first, and I am an Arab-American,\" Fakih said in 2010. \"I am Lebanese-American, and I am Muslim-American.\"\nKhalid Khannouchi\u00a0Khannouchi is the fastest American marathon runner alive. He set the world record for marathon in 1999 in Chicago, and held the record until 2003. \nHe was born in Morocco, but dissatisfied with his country\u2019s athletic training resources, moved to New York in the early 1990s and made ends meet with a job washing dishes. At night, after work, he trained by running through the pot-holed streets of Brooklyn.\n\u201cIt's my dream to run for America. I want to give something back,\u201d Khannouchi said after he won his title in 1999. \"The words 'thank you' are nothing. I really want to do something for America.\"\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that the global Muslim population is 1.6 billion, not 1.6 million.", "title": "If Trump Had His Way, These Muslims Would Never Have Made America Great"}
