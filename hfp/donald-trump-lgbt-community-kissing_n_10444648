But it looked pretty out there to me,\" Trump said of the kiss in an interview on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends.\"\nThe mogul later added, \u201cI\u2019ve heard many people \u2014 I\u2019m not even speaking for myself, but I\u2019ve heard many people that thought the display after he was chosen was inappropriate. And whether or not it was, I don\u2019t know. But it was certainly out there a little bit. And I\u2019m very happy that he got chosen, I\u2019m all for it. I think it\u2019s great actually that he got chosen. I hope he does so well. But I thought when he \u2014 he was really going at it... I haven\u2019t seen anything like that in a while.\u201d\nLGBT voters support Clinton over Trump, 84 percent to 16 percent, according to a recent Whitman Insight Strategies survey. Over the weekend, Trump also assured a conference of Christian conservatives that he opposes marriage equality.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Wasn't Always Such A Defender Of The LGBT Community"}
