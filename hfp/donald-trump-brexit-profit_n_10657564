The majority of Scotland had voted to remain.\nAsked about the uncertainty of the pound, Trump responded by pointing out how he stood to benefit from a weaker currency. It's not the first time Trump has boasted about profiting off a weak economy.\n\u201cIf the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,\u201d he said at a press conference. \u201cFor traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be positive.\u201d\nSpoken like a true statesman.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Boasts About Making Money Off British Economic Uncertainty"}
