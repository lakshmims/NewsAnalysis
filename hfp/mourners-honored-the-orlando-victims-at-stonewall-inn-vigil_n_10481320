The vigil took place outside of Manhattan's Stonewall Inn, which many consider to be the birthplace of the queer rights movement.\n\"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\" star Tituss Burgess crooned\u00a0a tender rendition of \"Somewhere\" from the musical \"West Side Story\" as mourners wrote down the names of the 49 victims. At the end, attendees held candles and embraced one another as each of the victim's names were read aloud.\u00a0\nVideo by Savannah O'Leary, production assistance by Isabella Carapella and Nick Offenberg\u00a0\nDonate to Orlando here:\u00a0", "title": "New Yorkers Honored The Orlando Victims At Stonewall Inn Vigil"}
