I didn\u2019t do anything, and I\u2019m only 10 years old. I\u2019m Mexican and I\u2019m Muslim.\u201d\u00a0\nTo better explain how Trump's Islamophobic and racist rhetoric have made him feel, Andrew launches into a little song that he wrote on the topic.\u00a0\n\u201cDonald Trump. Donald Trump. That guy should really live in a dump. That fool, he\u2019s not cool,\u201d he sings, in part, to the tune of the \u201cSpider-Man\u201d theme song. \u201cHe\u2019s bad, and that makes me mad. I get sad when I see his face, \u2018cause he\u2019s always judging other people by their race.\u201d\nAccording to Fusion,\u00a0Andrew\u2019s mother,\u00a0Nahela Morales, helped her son start his Facebook page in an effort to help him stay in touch with his friends in Mexico, but it has since become a bilingual platform from which Andrew encourages racial and religious tolerance and discusses political issues.\nIn a video uploaded in November, Andrew addresses one of the bigoted tenets on which Trump has built his platform: Islamophobia. \"I am Andrew. I am 10 years old,\" he says. \"I am Mexican. I am Muslim. I am not a terrorist. Not in my name.\"\u00a0Andrew joins countless other young people in their distaste for the presumptive Republican nominee.\u00a0Earlier this year, The Huffington Post launched our Teens Against Trump essay contest, during which we asked teens to share how the prospect of having Trump as President of the U.S. made them feel. Before we knew it, our inbox was flooded with entries, one of which came from the winner of the contest, Zia T., a 19-year-old English major at Howard University in Washington, D.C.\n\"As I\u2019m watching the presidential campaign unfold, it completely baffles me how far Republican front-runner Donald Trump has gotten in the race for the White House,\" she wrote. \"With everything he has said about people with disabilities, immigrants, and many others, he should have been out of the running a long time ago. But here we are, heading into the primaries and his campaign is thriving. I know for a fact I don\u2019t want myself, or anyone else, to live in Trump\u2019s version of America.\"\nNeither do we.\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\nH/T Fusion", "title": "Watch This 11-Year-Old Latino Muslim Stand Up To Trump\u2019s Hateful Rhetoric"}
