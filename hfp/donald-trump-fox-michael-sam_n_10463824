In it, Trump phones in to \"Fox & Friends,\" and gives the most circuitous, evasive statement possible when discussing the then-polarizing topic of Michael Sam\u2019s draft day kiss with former boyfriend Vito Cammisano.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become so politically correct in this country that the country is going to hell -- people are afraid to talk,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to express their own thoughts ... I\u2019ve heard many people,\u00a0I\u2019m not even speaking for myself, but I\u2019ve heard many people that thought the display after he was chosen was inappropriate.\u201d\n\"And whether or not it was, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut it was certainly out there a little bit. And I\u2019m very happy that he got chosen. I\u2019m all for it. I think it\u2019s great that he got chosen. I hope he does so well.\u201d\nAnd then came the kicker:\u00a0\u201cBut I thought, when he ... you know, when --\u00a0when he was really going at it. I mean, whether --\u00a0that ... I -- I haven\u2019t seen anything like that in a while. He was really going at it.\u201d\nIt seems that Trump isn\u2019t (or at the very, very least, wasn\u2019t) as staunch a supporter of the \u201cLB\u201d community as he tried to make it appear on the stage this week.\nH/T Gawker.", "title": "Let\u2019s All Cringe At Donald Trump Discussing Michael Sam\u2019s Kiss In 2014"}
