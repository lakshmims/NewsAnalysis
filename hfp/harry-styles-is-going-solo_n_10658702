The news of Styles\u2019 solo career comes less than a year after the band announced an indefinite hiatus.\u00a0\nStyles is the second member to leave the world\u2019s most famous boy band, as former member Zayn Malik left in March 2015 to \u201cbe a normal 22-year-old.\u201c Malik released a solo album, \u201cMind of Mine,\u201d in March 2016.\nRumors of a solo Styles project swirled in late 2015, when the singer registered four songs with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Styles has 40 songs registered on ASCAP, yet they all list One Direction as the performer. However, the four new songs he\u2019d registered \u2014\u00a0\u201c5378 Miles,\u201d \u201cAlready Home,\u201d \u201cCoco\u201d and \u201cEndlessly\u201d \u2014 only list Styles as the performer.\nThe 22-year-old also joined Full Stop Management in March 2016,\u00a0headed by former Creative Artists Agency executive Jeffrey Azoff, who had Styles as a client previously.\u00a0\nThere is currently no set details on the deal or timeline for Styles\u2019 solo project, but rest assured that hearts are breaking for 1D fans all over the world, who will likely see this as a sign of no return for the boy band.\u00a0The group's mentor, Simon Cowell, told Billboard after One Direction's hiatus announcement,\u00a0\"I don't know if it's a hiatus or a breakup, to be honest. In a weird way, I don't want to know,\" he said. \"I don't think they've had enough time to experience what it's like not being in the group to really answer that.\"\nLuckily, fans have the band's five chart-topping albums to soothe their hearts, because it looks like \"Midnight Memories\" might be all they have left of their beloved One Direction.\u00a0", "title": "Harry Styles Is Going Solo, So One Direction Might Be 'History'"}
