Police have advised attendees to prepare for delays at the entrance.\nIn response, Black Lives Matter officials decided they'd no longer participate as organizational grand marshal for the parade, whose theme is \"For Racial and Economic Justice.\"\n\u201cAs queer people of color, we are disproportionately targeted by both vigilante and police violence. We know first hand that increasing the police presence at Pride does not increase safety for all people,\" said BLM member Malkia Cyril in a statement. \"Militarizing these events increases the potential for harm to our communities and we hope in the future SF Pride will consider community-centered approaches to security at pride events.\u201d\nThe announcement showed the difficulties of balancing safety with an inclusive atmosphere for groups who have often been threatened by law enforcement.\nThe San Francisco police department has been embroiled in controversy over its officers\u00a0fatally shooting African-Americans, as well as a scandal involving officers exchanging racist text messages.\u00a0\nJanetta Johnson, executive director of TGI Justice Project, a group for trans, intersex and gender-nonconforming people, also bowed out as the grand marshal for the parade.\u00a0\n\u201cWhile I am thankful for this honor, and grateful to Pride for bringing our work to the front this year, the decision to add more police to Pride does not make me, or my community, more safe,\" Johnson said in a statement.\u00a0\nA sex workers advocacy group that was slated to receive an award at the parade on Sunday had a similar criticism.\n\"These policies do not reflect the theme of racial and economic justice which we sought to march under proudly,\" St. James Infirmary Executive Director Stephany Ashley said in a statement.\u00a0\nParade organizers did not immediately respond to HuffPost's requests for comment.\u00a0", "title": "Black Lives Matter Drops Out Of SF Pride Parade After Organizers Increase Police Presence"}
