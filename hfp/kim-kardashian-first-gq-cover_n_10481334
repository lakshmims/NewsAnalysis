Even little sis Kendall Jenner beat her to the punch.\u00a0\nBut alas, here it is, finally:\u00a0And for good measure, here's another equally stunning shot, featuring a slightly more covered-up Kim.\u00a0As GQ writes on its website, \"Welcome to the #UnitedStatesofKimerica.\"\nTo see more photos from Kim's sexy shoot, head over to GQ.com.", "title": "Kim Kardashian Poses Nude, Naturally, On Her First-Ever GQ Cover"}
