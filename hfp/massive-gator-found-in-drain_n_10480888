What they found beneath the ground, however, was described as highly unusual.\nInside the 4-foot-wide catch basin, Department of Transportation officials reported hooking an 11-foot-long gator, one they were photographed hauling out of the Whiskey Creek neighborhood with an excavator.\nLee County's DOT says they typically handle one to two dead alligators in storm drains a year but rarely ones of this size.\n\"DOT generally is alerted to such situations by reports of odor coming from a catch basin or when drainage is backed up for no obvious reason,\" the county said in an emailed press release.\nLee County DOT Director Randy Cerchie called it business as usual.\n\"This was an abnormally large gator, but removal is part of what we do,\u201d he said in a statement.\nCounty spokeswoman Betsy Clayton told the News-Press that the gator likely entered the storm drain through the pipes.\nThe big question: How did it get in? The county describes the pipes leading to the drain as only about 14-inches by 24-inches.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t usually see gators that big because our pipes are not that big,\u201d Cerchie said.\nAccording to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, female American alligators rarely grow larger than 10-feet in length. Males can grow much larger, however.\nThe largest gator ever found in the state was 14-feet, 3 1/2-inches in length, the FWC reported.\nThe Lee County gator's body was hauled away in a dump truck to a DOT site that\u2019s designated for dead animals, and there it was buried, the county said.", "title": "11-Foot Gator Found Rotting In Neighborhood Storm Drain"}
