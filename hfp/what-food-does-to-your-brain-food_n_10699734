This may seem obvious, but obesity rates in America\u00a0are still on the rise, so it's time for a refresher!\u00a0\nFortunately, the lovely people at TED-Ed\u00a0put together the video above to show just how food affects the functioning of our brains.\u00a0Here are just a few of the things you need to know, along with a few pointers from other recent research:\nYour brain is mostly fat, and it needs fat from food to survive.\u00a0If you took out all the liquid from your brain, most of its weight would come from lipids (fats). The rest of the matter is made up of glucose, micronutrients, amino acids, and proteins, all of which are\u00a0fueled and replenished by the food we eat.\u00a0To keep your brain healthy, eat hearty when it comes to nuts, seeds, and fatty fish. The fatty acids are found only in those foods, and help to create and maintain new cell membranes. They also help\u00a0prevent degenerative brain conditions, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center.\u00a0\nWhat you eat could keep you from falling asleep.\u00a0If you're feeling alert late at night or lethargic after lunch, it's likely because your brain isn't happy with what you ate that day. Heavy, greasy foods close to bedtime will keep you up because they take your body more time to digest, the National Sleep Foundation reports. The caffeine in soft drinks and chocolate will also keep you from getting your ZZZs.\u00a0\nTrans fats are MEGA BAD for your brain.Trans fats, which are found most often in fried foods and highly-processed baked goods, will compromise brain health if you eat too much of them. Research shows that trans fats may worsen memory,\u00a0Live Science reports, and that those who eat a lot of them\u00a0are more likely to have a smaller brain.\u00a0Limiting your intake of these foods\u00a0will make your brain (and waistline!) happy.\u00a0\nWhat you eat may affect how you feel\u00a0Research suggests an association between improved mood and foods high in\u00a0omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, tryptophan, folate and other B vitamins, notes the Mayo Clinic. Eating fruits, vegetables, omega-3-rich foods, protein, and complex carbohydrates and drinking enough water could help\u00a0make a positive difference\u00a0in mood and well-being.\nTo avoid dips in attention span and mood, skip high-glycemic carbohydrates like white bread and dessert, which can send blood sugar levels in your brain skyrocketing before crashing. Complex carbs like legumes and whole grains increase blood sugar levels at a slower pace, which helps your brain remain more attentive and focused.\u00a0\nWatch the video above,\u00a0and prepare to have your mind BLOWN.", "title": "This Is What Food Does To Your Brain"}
