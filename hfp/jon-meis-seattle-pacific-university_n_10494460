Ybarra, 26, shoot a female student with a shotgun. When Ybarra pauses to reload, student-safety monitor Jon Meis jumps from behind a corner, pepper-sprays the assailant in the face, tackles him to the floor and takes away the shotgun. After stashing the weapon out of the view of the security camera, Meis returns and grabs the killer in a headlock.\nWARNING: GRAPHIC VIDEOPaul Lee, 19, of Portland, was killed\u00a0in the June 5, 2014, attack. Two other students were wounded.\nYbarra, who had a history of mental illness, is scheduled to go on trial in September on charges of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder. Ybarra and his attorney are reportedly pursuing an insanity defense.\nMeis quickly emerged as a hero, credited with saving other students' lives.\n\"I knew that if I didn't stop him, he would keep going,\" Meis said of the gunman, in an interview with NBC News.\nSeattle Pacific University said in statement Monday it was \"disappointed\" by the release of surveillance videos.\u00a0\n\"We, along with others, have pursued legal action to stop the videos' release in order to protect individual privacy and prevent the emotional distress these images will have on our community,\" the university said. \"Seattle Pacific University remains strong and resilient as a result of God\u2019s faithfulness to us. Our foremost concern continues to be the welfare and safety of not only our students, faculty, and staff, but of the victims and witnesses of the tragedy.\"", "title": "Video Shows Student's Heroic Takedown Of Gunman During Seattle Pacific University Shooting"}
