I wish he picked no place.\"\nHenson said the gunman separately purchased the two firearms --\u00a0a handgun and an AR-15-type assault rifle\u00a0--\u00a0a week to 10 days prior to Sunday's massacre\u00a0--\u00a0the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\nDuring the short press conference, Henson said he wanted to avoid political issues. He said the shooter passed the same background check every other customer in Florida must pass, and urged everyone to pray for the victims.\n\"An evil person came in here and they legally purchased two firearms from us,\" Henson said. \"And if he hadn't purchased them from us, I'm sure he would have gotten them from another local gun store in the area.\"CORRECTION: A previous headline on this story said the gun shop is in Orlando.
