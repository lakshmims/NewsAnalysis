Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) attributed the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the European Union to dissatisfaction over the global economy, but declined to offer his opinion on the decision itself.\nIn an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday, Sanders expressed concern about \u201cthe breaking down of international cooperation,\u201d noting the important role that the EU has played in bringing peace to Europe.\n\u201cEurope in the 20th century, as we all know -- the kind of blood that we shed there is unimaginable -- you never want to see that again,\u201d he said.\nBut Sanders went on to argue that the vote for a British exit, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d reflected some of the same economic frustrations that propelled his insurgent presidential candidacy.\u201cWhat this vote is about is an indication that the global economy is not working for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not working in the United States for everybody and it\u2019s not working in the U.K. for everybody. When you see investors going to China and shutting down factories in this country and laying off, over a period of many years, millions of people, people are saying you know what, global economy may be great for some people but not for me.\u201d\nSanders proposed strengthening global ties while ensuring that people can live in dignity.\n\u201cSo what we need to do is create a situation where there is some more international cooperation. We put an end to these horrific wars that we have seen over the years,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut at the same time we do not forget about the people left behind and we make sure we have jobs, and income, and health care for all of our people.\u201d\nSanders twice declined to explicitly say whether he agreed or disagreed with the Brexit decision.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let the people of the U.K. make that decision,\u201d he said.\nSanders also stated his intention to vote for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton elsewhere in the interview. \nUnlike Sanders, Clinton did not reflect on the Brexit vote\u2019s broader political implications in a statement on the vote.\n\u201cWe respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOur first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\u201d\nClinton managed to use the opportunity to offer veiled criticism of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\u201cThis time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House,\u201d she said. \u00a0", "title": "Bernie Sanders On Brexit: \u2018The Global Economy Is Not Working For Everybody\u2019"}
