A quick look at Twitter posts from around that same time showed that multiple people were doing the same thing.\nPaul McCartney has said that \u201cPet Sounds\u201d made him cry and that \u201cGod Only Knows\u201d is his favorite song\u00a0in all of music history.\nWith thousands of fellow festival-goers and dozens of Brooklynites on park-adjacent balconies and rooftops collectively welling as Wilson played the song, it was hard not to join in the tears, and I certainly did.\nBut when \"God Only Knows\"\u00a0was done, Wilson pulled a joke perhaps equally as good as the preceding song, going straight into a rendition of \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" and begging the audience to sing along with him.\nThe disconnect between the Beach Boys' work from the\u00a0\"Pet Sounds\" era and the rest of their surfing-and-girls-focused discography has always been curious. Earlier this year, Jardine told The Huffington Post\u00a0that the very release of such a complicated and revolutionary album \"was not expected\" from the band. Jardine said, \"Because we were The Beach Boys, remember? I mean, come on, with a name like that? It took a while to realize there was a genius [Wilson] in our midst.\u201d\nThat Wilson took a break from playing \"Pet Sounds\" for a children's melody about the sea -- especially immediately after a song that Pitchfork has called the greatest of the entire 1960s -- is easily one of best things I have ever seen.\nThe crowd sang along to the children's tune, but after about 30 seconds, Wilson had already thanked the audience and switched back to \"Pet Sounds.\" He then finished the album all the way through without diversion.\nAt the end of \"Caroline, No,\" the iconic train noise that closes the album blasted over the speaker. Wilson exclaimed that it was a good vibration. Then the band played \"Good Vibrations\" -- a track originally meant for\u00a0\"Pet Sounds\" -- and ended the show with \"Barbara Ann,\" \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" and \"Fun Fun Fun.\"\nThe opportunity to see Brian Wilson play through \"Pet Sounds\" meant a lot to those present at Brooklyn's McCarren Park. The head booker for the festival, Lauren Beck, claimed that one of her earliest memories is telling her parents \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" is the \"greatest song ever written.\"\u00a0Dana Keith, the festival's director, told HuffPost that the same song literally shaped her life --\u00a0her parents got engaged after hearing it on the radio.\nAs Wilson played Northside, large balloons with smiley faces bounced around the crowd. One almost hit Wilson's head. Rarely is positive energy so abundant that a good thing can actually hit you in the face.", "title": "The Strangest Thing Brian Wilson Has Ever Done"}
