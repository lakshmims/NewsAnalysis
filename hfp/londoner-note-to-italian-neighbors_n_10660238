Mattia works for a marketing company in the U.K. and Adele works at an art gallery, and they have been living in the country for about two years.\u00a0\nHere is what David wrote:\nMattia and Adele,\nThis is awful news this morning of course, but I hope you realise that you are welcome here, that you give so much to London by choosing to live here and that I hope you will stay and be part of the city for many, many years.\nDavid\n\nOn a day clouded by uncertainty, Mattia and Adele found the note uplifting.\n\u201cThis unexpected letter made us very happy,\u201d Adele told HuffPost Italy. \u201cA small gesture that makes us feel less lost in front of the outcome of the referendum.\u201d\nItalians, like other EU citizens, have been free to live and work in the U.K. \nThursday\u2019s Brexit vote will not change that overnight; Britain now has two years to renegotiate its relationship to the EU.\nIt is likely that the U.K. will keep some free movement provisions in place for people from EU countries to retain critical access to the bloc's single market.\nBut as WorldPost reported, that has not prevented many residents of the U.K. from other European countries from growing anxious about what a Brexit could mean for them.\n\u201cEverything that happens today will affect me, without me having anything to do with it,\u201d Marlou Hermsen, a Dutch citizen living in Liverpool, England, told The WorldPost on Thursday.\nA version of this piece was originally published on HuffPost Italy, and has been translated into English and adapted for a U.S. audience.", "title": "Londoner\u2019s Moving Post-Brexit Note To Italian Neighbors Shows Power Of European Unity"}
