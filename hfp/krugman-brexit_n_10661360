He raised three main points that should calm some nerves:\u00a0\n\n\nThe value of the pound plunged on Friday, but far from the levels seen during the recession in the early 1970s, when the currency fell by a third, he noted.\n\n\nBritain borrows in its own currency, allowing it to avoid a \"classic balance-sheet crisis due to currency devaluation.\"\u00a0\n\n\nNegotiations to leave the EU could take up to two years, and Krugman said he could see CEOs choosing to delay any spending moves until the path forward becomes more clear.\n\n\nStill, Krugman said the Brexit underscores serious problems within the EU:\n\nIt seems clear that the European project \u2013 the whole effort to promote peace and growing political union through economic integration \u2013 is in deep, deep trouble. Brexit is probably just the beginning, as populist/separatist/xenophobic movements gain influence across the continent. Add to this the underlying weakness of the European economy, which is a prime candidate for \u201csecular stagnation\u201d \u2013 persistent low-grade depression driven by things like demographic decline that deters investment. Lots of people are now very pessimistic about Europe\u2019s future, and I share their worries.\n\n\nHe summed his thoughts in three points: \"calm down about the short-run macroeconomics; grieve for Europe, but you should have been doing that already; worry about Britain.\"\u00a0\n", "title": "Paul Krugman: 'Yes, Brexit Will Make Britain Poorer'"}
