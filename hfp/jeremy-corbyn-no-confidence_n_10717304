Prime Minister David Cameron has promised to resign, triggering a leadership contest in his ruling Conservative Party.\nThough widely expected, the Labour vote of no confidence underscores the depth of oppositionCorbyn faces. The non-binding vote, however, does not automatically trigger a leadership election.\u00a0\nCORBYN DEFIANT\nCorbyn, who voted to leave the EU in a 1975 referendum, said he would not resign as leader.\n\"I was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60 percent of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning,\" he said.\n\"Today's vote by MPs (Members of Parliament) has no constitutional legitimacy.\"\nParliamentary colleagues have called on Corbyn to quit after more than 20 of his policy team publicly resigned. He was laughed at when called to make a speech in parliament on Monday, before attending a private meeting where more than a dozen lawmakers pleaded with him to quit.\nHis opponents in the Labour Party question whether he can ever win over voters in the party's heartlands.\nCorbyn has previously said he would stand again if the party did call a leadership contest. A leadership contest would have to take place if 51 or more Labour lawmakers pledge their support for an alternative candidate.\nBut Corbyn retains support among many party members and registered supporters outside parliament and they help to elect any new leader.\nIf Corbyn is challenged and retains power, the party could face further turmoil at a time when many Labour supporters say it should be focusing more than ever on challenging the Conservative government and offering ways to overcome Britain's post-referendum crisis.\n\u00a0\n(Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Gareth Jones)", "title": "UK Labour Party Backs No Confidence Motion On Leader Jeremy Corbyn"}
