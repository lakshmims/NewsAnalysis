They tie one end of a string to the tooth, and the other to a tantalizing hunk of granola. They sit. They wait. The squirrels begin to circle, and what happens next is, well, nuts.\nWe\u2019re not sure most dentists would recommend this method of tooth extraction. Interacting with wildlife always carries some risks, (though squirrels almost never carry rabies) and items like string can potentially harm squirrels. Luckily, this dad got the string (and tooth!) back and everything appears to have turned out fine. \nKudos to this fearless team!\u00a0", "title": "Watch This Dad Use A Live Squirrel To Pull His Daughter's Tooth"}
