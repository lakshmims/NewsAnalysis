Maturity and life experience are an asset.\nBelow, six divorcees share reasons why dating after divorce is often better than it was pre-marriage.\n1.\u00a0Dating someone new after so many years can be intoxicating.\n\"By the time of my divorce, it had been 24 years since I\u2019d so much as had coffee with another man. The notion of dating was scary, but also terribly exciting just by virtue of the newness of it. The smell of a different cologne, the sound of a different laugh, the rhythm of a different dance partner -- the anticipation of all that was exhilarating to me. And that first kiss from my date who eventually became my husband was heart-pounding, head-spinning, spine-tingling, weak-in-the-knees wonderment. I may have been 45 years old, but my inner teenager was swooning.\" -- Lee Gaitan\u00a0\n2. Your date has experience in the bedroom.\n\"Women my age were usually already experienced in the bedroom and were more eager to explore their sensual side with me. I had become more skillful as well and found that my partner responded positively to it, compared to before when I had no idea what I was doing.\" -- Philip Damon\u00a03.\u00a0You can cut right to the chase.\n\"One evening [after I'd been divorced], I was dancing on a speaker because, well, that\u2019s what I did back in the day, and a man made eye contact with me from the dance floor. When security insisted I get down, this man helped me off the speaker. We started talking. I was very straight-forward and asked him questions like, what did he do for a living, what happened in his last relationship, did he have kids, did he like kids,\u00a0was he ever arrested and did he own a cat? In other words, I cut to the chase. I think we went on one date after we met, and that date was more of a, 'Hey are you hungry? Let\u2019s go get some food.' Five years later, we were married.\" -- Andrea Tate\n4. You're quicker to cut your losses.\n\"When I was younger I was worried about hurting feelings or if I was being nice enough. Now I know, pretty quickly, if it's worth my precious spare time. If it is? Wonderful. If not? Bye!\" -- Jennifer Ball\u00a05. You may have more spending money at this stage in life.\n\"After my divorce, I found that I had more resources to do things with. Dinner and a movie turned into fine dining and a symphony.\" --\u00a0Philip Damon\n6. You're likely in less of a rush to get married again.\n\"In my post-divorce dating life, I don\u2019t need the man I\u2019m dating to promise to spend his life with me for us to have an amazing time together in the present. I\u2019ve already had one trip down the aisle, one wonderful marriage and one painful divorce, and I\u2019m good with that. My goal now,\u00a0after the divorce dust has settled, is simply to meet someone who I love spending time with,\u00a0someone who makes me laugh and someone who shares common interests. I don\u2019t need assurance that the relationship will last forever because if divorce has taught me anything, it\u2019s that there are no guarantees in life and that nothing is permanent. Accepting this takes the pressure off the relationship and instead leads to more freedom and joy\u2026 and a lot more fun!\" -- Danielle Porter", "title": "Better Sex And 5 More Reasons Dating After Divorce Is Great"}
