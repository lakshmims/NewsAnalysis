Period.\n\nRose shared her thoughts on the Stanford sexual assault case in an interview with Cosmopolitan.com.\u00a0She stressed to Cosmo that \"Yes\" is always required. \"The whole day before, she could say, 'Hey, we're totally gonna have sex tonight,' but if she passes out, that is not consent. You have to literally have it right before.\"\u00a0\nRose's feminism knows no bounds: she's currently planning her second L.A. SlutWalk, and uses her platform as a public figure to speak out about consent, slut shaming and sexism and double standards.\u00a0In her interview, she talked about making this year's SlutWalk bigger and better. \"It's kind of like a female version of Coachella,\" she said. \"We have different vendors. We have a bunch of tents you can go to and get educated. What rape is. Sexual assault. We have HIV and AIDS testing...We wanna have musical guests.\"\u00a0\nBeyond the SlutWalk, Rose talked about raising her son Sebastian as a feminist -- something she has proudly discussed before\u00a0-- and how she hopes that one day she'll date a male feminist.\u00a0\n\"I haven't had the pleasure. I would absolutely love that because that would be an ideal relationship for me,\" she said.\u00a0\nGood news, Amber -- we're pretty sure Matt McGorry is single.\u00a0", "title": "Amber Rose Will Talk About Consent Until Everyone Gets It"}
