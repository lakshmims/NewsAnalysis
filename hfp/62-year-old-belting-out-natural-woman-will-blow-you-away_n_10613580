Instead, we were introduced the the awe-inspiring talents of 62-year-old Ronee Martin.\nThe sexagenarian might be a bit older than the average contestant, but Martin didn't let that deter her. The normally unfriendly judge Simon Cowell, who is 56 himself, didn't seem fazed.\u00a0\n\"For me, it doesn't matter how old you are,\" Cowell said. \"If you've got it, you've got it.\"\nMartin started singing \"I Can't Make You Love Me,\" but it didn't do her justice. Soon, she was belting out \"A Natural Woman\" and the crowd went crazy.\u00a0\nWatch the video above to see why.\nWe have to agree with host Nick Cannon, who wanted to let Martin know he's single. \"Hey, 62 ain't nothin' but a number.\"\n\u00a0", "title": "62-Year-Old Belting Out 'Natural Woman' Will Blow You Away"}
