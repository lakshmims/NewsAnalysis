Sources, however, have told People and ET Online that Harris did not make the comments himself. (The Huffington Post has reached out to his reps and will update this post accordingly.)\nWhen one Swiftie asked why the Scottish DJ was \"jealous\" of Swift, and why he wore Yeezys shortly after she was spotted with her new beau, actor Tom Hiddleston, the reply was defiant:Harris' account then posted about Swift's response to the breakup:\u00a0And the comments just kept coming:\u00a0Since their posting, the comments about Swift have been deleted from Harris' account, and the DJ has yet to officially comment on the situation. After his split with the singer\u00a0in early June, Harris posted a thoughtful tweet that Swift shared on her account\u00a0-- but he later deleted it.Whether Harris really posted the Instagram comments is up for debate, but a story that circulated Thursday shows how much effort some people put into faking news about Taylor Swift.\nJust after Swift and Hiddleston\u00a0were spotted at a Selena Gomez concert in Nashville, a Belgian radio station claimed the actor gave an interview in which\u00a0he gushed about the singer, calling her\u00a0\"an absolute delight.\"\u00a0\nThe radio hosts later admitted that the whole thing was faked by piecing together sound clips of the actor's voice.", "title": "Calvin Harris' Instagram Comments Knocking Taylor Swift Might Be Fake"}
