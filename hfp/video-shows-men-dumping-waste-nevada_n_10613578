They're making us do this.\"\u00a0\nNone of the men in the video indicate where they work.A label on the barrel indicates that it holds\u00a0Hocut 795-H.\u00a0The substance's Pennsylvania-based manufacturer, Houghton International, describes that as a \"heavy-duty chlorine-free machining and grinding fluid that can be used with many machines and metals.\"\nThe barrel's label states that it is the responsibility of the product's user \"to determine, at the time of disposal, whether a material containing the product or derived from the product should be classified as hazardous waste.\"\u00a0It further advises users to avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing.\nA Houghton International spokeswoman told The Huffington Post that the company is looking into the matter and suspects that the product's safety requirements are not being followed.\nThe substance is hazardous per the 2012 Occupational Safety and Health Administration Hazard Communication Standard, according to an\u00a0online safety data sheet\u00a0bearing Houghton's name and a 2015 date.\n\"Do not flush into surface water or sanitary sewer system,\" the data sheet reads. \"Prevent product from entering drains. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be contained.\"\nThe Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, which enforces state laws pertaining to the environment, told HuffPost it has\u00a0\"received reports related to the YouTube video and is currently investigating to determine the extent and veracity of the claims.\"\"We've been doing this for weeks. The plants are starting to die and shit,\" the man filming says in the video. \"I don't know if we can get in trouble for this. I'm documenting this because I'm not trying to go to prison for this. We've been forced to do this. We've been told to do this. I have four children, that's the only reason why I'm doing this. This feels wrong, this is wrong.\"\nThere are federal\u00a0laws that protect whistleblowing employees from retaliation, including termination.\u00a0\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Department of Labor filed two federal lawsuits against two Houston companies accused of illegally firing employees who had made safety complaints to OSHA. The lawsuits seek back pay, reinstatement and other damages suffered by the employees due to the illegal terminations.\n\"Employees must be able to exercise their rights freely and raise concerns with their employers without fear of retribution,\u201d Eric Harbin, OSHA's Acting Regional Administrator for Region 6, said in a statement. \"We will hold employers accountable when they attempt to silence a worker who is concerned about their safety and the well-being of others. These lawsuits send a clear message that we will use all available enforcement tools, including litigation, to stop employers from engaging in retaliatory conduct.\"\nThis story has been updated with a comment from the NDEP.", "title": "Men Film Themselves Apparently Dumping Chemical Waste To Keep Their Jobs"}
