So, they\u2019re going to try an alternative, and more gentle approach instead.\nThe Los Angeles Police Commission approved a new policy on Tuesday that directs LAPD officers to treat homeless people with \u201ccompassion and empathy,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported.\nThe rules instruct officers to offer homeless people information about housing, medical or psychological services. They\u2019re also expected to respect homeless people's right to refuse help.\nThe policy change comes amid a tense and evolving climate in L.A.\nLast year, the city erupted in protests after LAPD officers shot and killed Charly Keunang, an unarmed homeless person on Skid Row. The case gained international attention after a bystander posted a video of the cops shooting Keunang six times. The officers\u2019 actions were deemed \u201cin policy.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the police brutality advocates are fighting. It\u2019s about finding constructive ways to help get people off the streets, instead of fending them off like criminals.\nL.A. is considered the country\u2019s \u201chomeless capital,\u201d where there are nearly 47,000 people living on the streets and in shelters.\u00a0\nTo help put an end to the issue, the city is preparing to roll out a $2 billion plan to fund about 14,000 housing units.\nBut providing shelter isn\u2019t a cure-all.\nOver the last year, L.A. has been softening authorities\u2019 approach to homeless people to help ease tensions and improve their opportunities.\nIn April, for example, a federal judge ruled that police can no longer indiscriminately confiscate homeless people\u2019s possessions on Skid Row. Homeless people are already limited in the amount of items they can carry around, and often cart their most valuable belongings, such as medications and identifications.\u00a0\nNow, cops have to give 24 hours' notice before taking someone\u2019s possessions away and the items have to be available for pick up during regular business hours. The ruling excluded anything that poses a threat to health and public safety.\nWhile some advocates say they\u2019re pleased with the new compassionate police policies, they say they\u2019re wary whether the new rules will be enforced.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll believe it when we see it,\u201d Carol Sobel, a civil rights attorney, told The Times.\u00a0\u201cYou can hand out all the policies you want \u2013\u00a0that doesn\u2019t make a difference unless you put enforcement behind it.\u201d", "title": "LAPD Cops Ordered To Treat Homeless People With 'Compassion'"}
