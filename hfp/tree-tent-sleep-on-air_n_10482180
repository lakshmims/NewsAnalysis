But the design was actually conceptualized to be the dream green camping experience.\n\u201cYou\u2019re off the ground, so you\u2019re not damaging any of the fauna or flora on the floor,\u201d Robert Shirley-Smith, Tentsile\u2019s head of sales in North America, told The Huffington Post. \u201cNo mole homes get trampled, no grass gets damaged, no flowers get damaged.\u201dAnd as long as you don\u2019t stay in one spot for too many nights in a row, everything growing below you will get enough light to keep growing, he said. \u201cYou can basically camp out and not have a physical footprint.\u201d\u00a0Tentsile started selling tree tents in 2013. The inspiration came from Shirley-Smith\u2019s brother Alex long before then, he said. The Ewok village in the 1983 Star Wars film \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d sparked Alex\u2019s interest in tree architecture and, after he pursued training as an architect, led to the design of the tree tent.\u00a0\nThe idea was to create a living space in the trees that was affordable, habitable and eco-friendly.\u00a0\u00a0Another way the company has stayed true to its green roots is its policy to plant three trees for every tent sold on its website. Tentsile partnered with the non-profit WeForest to get the trees planted.\n\u201cYou need three trees for every tent, so we thought we\u2019d plant three trees for every tent,\u201d Shirley-Smith explained. \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been doing literally since the beginning of our company.\u00a0\n\"We\u2019ve planted a good number of trees now.\u201d\nThe tents range from $350 to $650 and can be shipped to most places around the globe.\u00a0Each one comes with all the equipment you need to set it up, including a rain cover (but not including the trees). The company also sells accessories like lightweight ladders, spare straps, tree protectors to prevent bark damage at camps longer than a few days, and even drink holders.\u00a0\u00a0And while Shirley-Smith said the tents are easy to set up after watching a 10-minute instructional video from the company, he cautioned that Tentsile\u00a0strongly recommends a four-foot height limit for suspending the tent. The higher and other extreme setups in this video and on the company\u2019s website were done by professionals, he added.\n\u201cWe strongly urge: If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, you shouldn\u2019t be doing it,\u201d he said.\nStill, waking up suspended in the trees beats the backache that comes from a deflated air mattress.\nSarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post\u2019s sleep reporter.
