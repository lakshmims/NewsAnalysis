Scientists declared it extinct in a comprehensive report published this month.The rat lived on Bramble Cay, a small island at the northern end of the Great Barrier Reef\u00a0that sits only 10 feet above sea level at its highest point, according to National Geographic.\nIn 1978, there were hundreds of the little creatures on Bramble Cay, but as the portion of the island sitting above the high-tide mark has shrunk over the years, so has the amount of habitat available for rodents.\nIn 2004, Bramble Cay provided about 5.4 acres of habitat for the critters. By 2014, rising tides had depleted that area to only about 0.16 acres. That\u2019s a 97 percent loss of habitat in just a decade.Those rising tides are the result of two major factors. The first is \u201csevere meteorological events\u201d like La Nina. The authors of this month's report, who include researchers from Australia's Department of Environment and Heritage Protection and the University of Queensland, note that dramatic events like this have \"been linked to climate change, specifically the increase in global mean temperature.\"\nBut extreme weather events aren\u2019t the only factor. Rising sea levels, which the researchers note are \u201cmostly attributable\u201d to climate change caused by human activity, also cause higher tides.\nThe report declaring the Bramble Cay melomys extinct is based on a 2014 survey of Bramble Cay, during which time researchers found no trace of the animal despite \"exhaustive efforts.\" The last known sighting of the Bramble Cay melomys was in 2009.\nThere is a chance the species might not be gone for good.\u00a0The researchers say it's possible an undetected population might exist somewhere in Papua New Guinea. (One theory about how the melomys got to Bramble Cay in the first place is that it may have come from Papua New Guinea.) Researchers are currently unaware of any Bramble Cay melomys populations living in Papua New Guinea, but the report recommends a survey of the country\u2019s Fly River region to look for them.\nStill, the researchers recommend changing the animal's conservation status from \"endangered\" to \"extinct in the wild,\" at least within Australia.\nThe species\u2019 apparent disappearance \u201cprobably represents the first recorded mammalian extinction due to anthropogenic climate change,\u201d they write.\nScientists predict that one-fourth of all the species on Earth could be headed for extinction by 2050 if climate change continues at its current rate.", "title": "This Is Probably The First Mammal Extinct Because Of Man-Made Climate Change"}
