How will the Brexit affect Americans traveling to Europe this summer?\nTravel to the U.K. could be cheaper.\nIn the wake of Thursday's vote, the British pound hit\u00a0a 30-year low. Currently it costs $1.37 American dollars to get one pound, down from\u00a0$1.50 on Thursday.\u00a0While this is terrible news for Britons, it's good news for Americans if the dollar continues to surge. \"With a significantly improved exchange rate, Britain is effectively on sale, giving American tourists a fantastic opportunity to visit this historically expensive country on the cheap,\" said ThePointsGuy.com editor-in-chief Zach Honig.\u00a0Vacationers traveling to the U.K.\u00a0this summer will likely get more bang for their buck in London and other favorite spots like Edinburgh and Belfast.\u00a0Travel to Europe from the U.K. might be pricier.\nIf you're planning on country-hopping through Europe after your visit to Britain, be prepared for higher airfares. Discount airlines like RyanAir and EasyJet keep prices low in part due to an open skies policy in Europe. Now that Britain is exiting the EU, these airlines will likely have to deal with new, more restrictive air service agreements, which could ultimately lead to more expensive flights.Travelers could be in for a major headache with longer U.K. customs lines.\nAt London's Heathrow airport and other U.K. ports of entry, customs lines move relatively quickly due to EU citizens' ability to enter through a separate line without any restrictions. When the Brexit is in effect, EU travelers could potentially join Americans\u00a0(and everyone else) in one big line for non-U.K. citizens. Charlie Leocha, president of consumer advocacy group Travelers United, told Bloomberg he expects that travel in and out of the U.K.\u00a0\"will be an absolute horror show.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nUltimately, we're all in for a rough stock market ride.\nWhile the Brexit vote might have a few upsides for Americans traveling to Britain, stock market volatility is still a major concern. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned\u00a0before the vote that Britain's exit from the European Union could have \"significant economic repercussions.\" Over the next few days, expect to see a major rebalancing of currencies as investors' confidence in the EU and Britain wavers.\nThis post has been updated to include additional quotes.", "title": "What Does The Brexit Mean For Americans Traveling To Europe?"}
