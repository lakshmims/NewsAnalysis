But I felt it. I looked down, and there it was, rattling,\" Benson told the Washington Post. \"I was like, \u2018You gotta be [kidding] me. Did this really just happen?'\"\nJohnny brushed off the attack until Laura urged him to look at the ankle.\nWhen they saw the bite marks, Johnny had one thought.\n\"The only thing I could think of is we\u2019re going to miss our big expensive party,\" he said.\nThe couple managed to flag down a ranger, according to photographer Maddie Mae.\n\u201cAll three of us started waving furiously at him. He rolls down the window and we yelled, \u2018He just got bit by a rattlesnake!\u2019\u201d Mae told ABC News.\u00a0\u201cThe ranger, obviously not hearing what we said, yelled back, \u2018Congratulations!\u2019\u201d\nThe ranger then saw Benson in distress and had him lie down and elevate his leg while he called the paramedics.Not knowing how much venom might have been injected into the groom, the couple went to a local hospital instead of their wedding reception. \u00a0\nLuckily, there were no signs of venom injection, nor was there any swelling or other symptoms, according to NewsChannel10.com.\nBut there were ample photo opportunities.The Bensons arrived late to their reception, but Laura had called to let guests know about the hospital detour. That gave one guest the chance to run to the store for some rubber snakes before the new couple arrived.\nIn addition, the couple added a garter-belt toss -- which wasn't originally part of the ceremony -- but they used a fake snake instead, according to the Washington Post.", "title": "This Groom Got Bitten By A Rattlesnake While Taking Wedding Photos"}
