The singer, who welcomed her daughter Jolie Rae Caussin on Jan. 31,\u00a0captioned the photo, \"And it begins. #babyfood.\"In the comments section, many fans showed support for the famous mama. But the singer also noticed a storm of comments criticizing her decision to purchase baby food and imploring her to make it herself. Examples include:\n\n\"Make your own!!! Don't buy jars. Yes they're convenient but not as nutritious as mummy's home made\"\n\"Make your own. It's cheaper and way healthier ;)\"\n\"why not make them instead?!\"\n\"Make your own it'll save money and it's better for her\"\n\"My sister made her own baby food. Much healthier and now my nephew is almost five won't touch processed food\"\n\"So easy to make your own! Steam and pur\u00e9e pretty much any fruit or veggie. Great way to avoid pesky preservatives!\"\n\nKramer responded to the unsolicited advice with a follow-up Instagram post.\u00a0The photo shows a note, which reads,\u00a0\"Dear Mommy Shamers, Unless you are Jolie's doctor, her father, or her mom, do NOT tell me how to raise my child, or how to feed her. Sincerely, Jolie's MOM.\"\nIn the caption for the photo, Kramer expanded on her statement.\u00a0\"I have been very open with pictures of my daughter and our journey because my true fans have been on my journey from day one and I want them to be a part of my new journey now,\" she wrote, adding, \"If you have negative comments about how I parent my child, keep it to yourself!!\"\nKramer's post gets straight to the point, but she told AOL that her initial impulse was to write something \"a little nastier.\"\n\"In my head I wanted to be like, 'OK, screw off' -- but I knew that wasn't the way to do it,\" she said, noting,\u00a0\"People write negative stuff on my Instagram and Twitter all the time, but when it's attacking me as a mother and my daughter -- that hits so much harder.\"\nThe country star also shared her thoughts on the overall trend of parent shaming.\n\"We're all going to raise our children differently,\" she said. \"Moms need all the help we can get, and I just wish that we would all work together and not against each other.\"\nSounds simple enough!", "title": "Country Star Fires Back At Mom Shamers With Viral Instagram Post"}
