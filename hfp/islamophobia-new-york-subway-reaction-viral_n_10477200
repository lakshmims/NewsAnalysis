Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to ban Muslims into the U.S.,\u00a0social media has been rife with anti-Muslim rhetoric\u00a0and there's evidence of the news media\u00a0promoting\u00a0such bigotry.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut a New York City woman is reminding us of how much good and love there remains in our communities, with a moving Facebook post she published this week.\nAmaira Hasan, 25, was on the train on her way to work on Monday morning when an unidentified white man wheeling a baby in a stroller entered and began yelling at two Muslim women wearing hijabs.\nHe told the \u201ctwo terrorist foreigners to go back to where they came from,\u201d Hasan wrote in her Facebook post. \u201cThe man insisted that the two women go back home and take their bombs with them.\u201d\nThe train erupted in anger as a diverse group of passengers confronted the man,\u00a0Hasan said.\n\u201cA black man, a Romanian, a gay man, a bunch of Asians, and a score of others came to [the women\u2019s] defense demanding that this man leave these women alone and get off this train,\u201d Hasan wrote.\nHasan told the New York Daily News that the man quieted down after one passenger told him pointedly: \u201cThis is New York City. The most diverse place in the world. And in New York, we protect our own and we don't give a fuck what anyone looks like or who they love, or any of those things. It's time for you to leave these women alone, Sir.\u201dHasan said the man soon got off the train, though it\u2019s unclear if a train conductor was involved in his departure.\u00a0The Metropolitan Transportation Authority told DNA Info that it had no record of the incident.\nHasan, who practices Islam but does not wear a hijab, said she was extremely proud to see her fellow New Yorkers standing up for two strangers, especially given the current climate.\n\u201cIn troubling times, people are scared,\u201d she told DNA Info,\u00a0\u201cbut it\u2019s nice to see that end of the day, people are looking out for one another, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\u00a0Hasan's story is one example of how people have been challenging hate in the wake of the Orlando tragedy.\nLGBT activist Jacob Tobia penned a Facebook post condemning Islamophobia hours after the hours after shooting in Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, on Sunday.\u00a0It has since gone viral.Also on Sunday, as his family awaited news of his sister, who had gone to Pulse with friends, Brian Alvear reminded people on social media to not blindly cast blame.\n\u201cListen I know a lot is happening and this a horrible thing and my family is dealing with it firsthand, but don't you fucking dare blame this on a group of people, this was 1 sick mother fucker. Don't blame anything but that,\u201d he wrote.\nAlvear soon learned that his sister, Amanda, was one of the 49 people killed in the massacre.\u00a0\n\u201cI know my sister and I know my parents and I know me, and we don\u2019t want to spread a message of hate,\u201d Alvear told ABC News in a later interview. Amanda would've wanted the family to \u201cunify in love,\u201d he stressed.\n\nRead more on the Orlando Shooting:\nCelebrities And Politicians React To Mass Shooting At Queer Orlando Nightclub\nBlood Donors Needed After Orlando Gay Club Shooting, But Queer Men Are Banned\nCongress Is \u2018Complicit\u2019 In Orlando Slaughter, Senator Says\nBarack Obama On Orlando Shooting: \u2018We Will Not Give In To Fear\u2019\nPulse Nightclub Was A Lifeline For Orlando\u2019s LGBTQ Community\nJames Corden Opens Tony Awards With Powerful Message To Orlando Shooter\nOrlando Vigils Around The World Fight Hate With Love, Unity\n", "title": "Man Calls Muslim Women \u2018Terrorists\u2019 On The NYC Subway, Gets Shut Down In The Best Way"}
