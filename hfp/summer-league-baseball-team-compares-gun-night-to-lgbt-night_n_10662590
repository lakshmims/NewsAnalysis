As general manager Tony Iovieno of the Bombers, the team hosting the event, told TMZ on Friday, \"You can't please everyone.\"\nTwo days after hosting Pride Night, the Bombers' Gun Night on Friday has been billed as both \"Gun Safety & Education Night\" and \"2nd Amendment Education Night.\"\u00a0Essentially, the Bombers' promotion invites fans to openly bring their guns to the game, inviting scrutiny from gun violence prevention advocates for inappropriately \"glorifying guns\"\u00a0so recently after a mass shooting.\n\"There are always going to be folks who don\u2019t agree with what we do,\" he said. \"We just had LGBT Pride Night the other night, and some people didn\u2019t like that either. You can\u2019t please everyone.\"Boy Scouts and fans with firearms will mingle at Friday night's Bombers game.\u00a0\nIovieno told the Battle Creek Enquirer on Friday that the team doesn't have a political stance on firearms, and called recent mass shootings \"horrific,\"\u00a0but added that he wants the night to spark conversation about gun violence.\n\"Who am I to take an odd political stance and say we can\u2019t do that?\" he said to the Enquirer. \"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role I have or what I should be doing. But I like that this is sparking a conversation because it\u2019s a conversation that should be had.\"\nThe gun control conversation is happening in Washington, on television and at the dinner table. But by inviting thousands of guns into a stadium, the Bombers are absolutely taking a political stance. Just as a team wouldn't host a Pride Night during June's Pride Month if they didn't support LGBTQ rights, throwing a \"2nd Amendment Education Night\" in partnership with gun shop Freedom Firearms during Gun Violence Awareness Month is telling.\nPeeling back the team's specious claims, teaching young people about gun safety for one night at a baseball game is a poorly veiled educational attempt. In reality, they're hosting a politicized gun rally. If they truly wanted to show a genuine attempt at gun education, the Bombers should've held \"Gun Night\" on June 2, which is National Gun Violence Awareness Day.\u00a0The team's home game on June 2 was $2 beer night.\"It's as American as baseball and apple pie,\"\u00a0Joel Fulton, co-owner of Freedom Firearms, said of the promotion to MLive.com on Thursday. \"And firearms are part of the fabric of our society.\"\nDefending the tonight's promotion, Iovieno addressed \"misconceptions\" about the event to TMZ. Noting that Michigan is an open carry state with a \"different culture\" to big U.S. cities, he said that he hopes the event will promote firearm safety. Displays from Freedom Firearms and the NRA's kid-targeted Eddie Eagle GunSafe Program will be placed throughout the stadium. In a state with a gun culture, as Iovieno stated, however, outright gun pride may overtake gun safety education at the game.\u00a0\nClaiming that the night had been planned months ago,\u00a0Iovieno said that ticketed fans who don't wish to attend can exchange them.\u00a0Extra police will be on hand for security\u00a0as an obvious precaution.\u00a0As for the sellout crowd, fans bringing guns will receive a wristband preventing them from buying alcohol and trigger locks for safety.\u00a0\nWith so many armed civilians, or \"good guys with guns,\" the Bombers' stadium will undoubtedly be the safest place in the United States on Friday night.\u00a0", "title": "Summer League Baseball Team Compares Its Gun-Education Night To LGBTQ Night"}
