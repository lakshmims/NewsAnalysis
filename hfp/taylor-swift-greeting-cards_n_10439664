While some have welcomed the new look in all its bleached blonde glory with open arms, others are left wondering if she's still the same Swift we once fell in love with.\u00a0\nWell, fear not, Swift purists. We now have proof that she's still the same cat-loving, wedding crashing,\u00a0baking extraordinaire of your wildest dreams,\u00a0and it comes in the form of her very own deliciously T-Swift greeting cards.\u00a0A collection of Taylor Swift greeting cards,\u00a0sold in\u00a0Papyrus\u00a0stores,\u00a0was first captured by a Swift\u00a0fan page and spotted by Elle.\u00a0The cards are now available in U.S. locations, and each one is more on-brand than the next. There are cats, there is sunshine, there is sparkle and there is even one that says, \"Yay you!\"It doesn't get much Swift-ier than that, people. \u00a0\nSome proceeds from the Swift-Papyrus partnership are going to charity. The brand confirmed on Instagram that the cards are, in fact, real, and said the cards shown are \"just the beginning.\"\u00a0Kind of gives \"Blank Space\" a whole new meaning, eh?We've reached out to Papyrus for more details; this post may be updated.\u00a0", "title": "Taylor Swift, Human Greeting Card, Now Has Her Own Line At Papyrus"}
