Major.\u00a0\nPrince William\u00a0just made history by becoming the first royal to ever cover a gay magazine. The prince,\u00a0who, along with his wife the Duchess of Cambridge and brother Prince Harry\u00a0have made mental health the main focus of their work, has long championed anti-bullying efforts and shattering stigma surrounding mental health.\nThis cover, and its corresponding meeting between William and LGBTQ youth who have experience dealing with both of those issues, further solidifies the royal family's commitment to spread awareness for anyone and everyone battling mental health issues.\u00a0Attitude Magazine, the UK's \"best-selling gay magazine,\" brought the group of young LGBTQ people to meet with the prince at Kensington Palace back in May so that he could \"listen to their experience of bullying and the mental health impacts it can have,\" according to a press release.\u00a0\nAfter meeting with the group and posing for his history-making cover shot, William spoke to the magazine about the \"truly brave\" young people he met with, praising their bravery to speak out and \"give hope to people who are going through terrible bullying right now.\"\n\"Their sense of strength and optimism should give us all encouragement to stand up to bullying wherever we see it,\" he said, adding, \"you should be proud of the person you are and you have nothing to be ashamed of.\"\u00a0The news comes just days after the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history occurred at gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando,\u00a0which killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. Will and the royal formerly known as Kate Middleton sent a message of support to victims on Tuesday at the U.S. Embassy in London. \u00a0It was there, speaking with staff members, that William revealed he would be appearing in the magazine.Junior Joye, one of the attendees at the event who, as a YouTuber has dealt with online bullying, told The Huffington Post it was \"absolutely phenomenal to meet such a man.\"\u00a0\n\"He was incredibly humble and actually listened to what we had to say. It was one of the best days of my life,\" he said.\u00a0\nCheck out a video from the meeting below, and to see more head to Attitude Magazine.\n\u00a0", "title": "Prince William Makes History As First Royal To Cover A Gay Magazine"}
