At times, it also means wearing elaborate, sometimes nonsensical hats to various social gatherings.\u00a0\nAs if simply wearing these hats wasn't a job enough in itself, some royals, like the Duchess of Cambridge, for example, also have to greet people wearing said hats -- all while keeping it on their head and looking poised.Of course, the media phenomenon formerly known as Kate Middleton\u00a0has undoubtedly become a pro at this after years of engagements and countless kisses.\nTake her appearance at day two of Royal Ascot on Wednesday -- her first appearance ever at the horse racing extravaganza -- wearing a hat by Jane Taylor. Watch as she leans forward to greet Princess Anne with the utmost grace and ease, their hats fitting perfectly together like two royal puzzle pieces:\u00a0Wearing a Dolce & Gabbana dress available for 40 percent off ($3,597)\u00a0in the current Net-A-Porter sale, Kate is proof that with a little practice, saying hello to your relatives while wearing an inconveniently placed headpiece is, in fact, possible.\u00a0Slay all day, duchess.\u00a0", "title": "The Duchess Of Cambridge Shows Us How To Kiss In A Fascinator"}
