A shooter\u00a0killed 49 people and injured at least 53 early Sunday when he stormed the club on Latin night, armed with a\u00a0Sig Sauer MCX, in what would become the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.\u00a0\nFood went to those on line as well as law enforcement working the scene, according to AL.com.\u00a0Chick-fil-A has come under fire over president Dan Cathy's statements against marriage equality\u00a0and the company's past donations to anti-gay groups. Cathy is a vocal Christian and the company has closed on Sundays since 1946 for both \"practical and spiritual reasons.\" \u00a0\nWhile Chick-fil-A has not released a statement on this particular gesture, a spokeswoman told The Huffington Post there are exceptions to their Sunday policy.\u00a0\n\nI can confirm that while we have a corporate policy that firmly states we are closed for business on Sundays, there have been rare cases that move our local operators to respond with food donations to help communities in need. The events in Orlando stirred our local restaurant owners and their teams to band together to provide nourishment to first responders as well as volunteers who donated blood. \u00a0We do not think this requires any recognition. \u00a0It is the least we can do in this community we love.\nThis article has been updated to note that, contrary to initial reports, the weapon used in Orlando was a Sig Sauer MCX, not an AR-15.", "title": "Chick-Fil-A Opens On Sunday To Give Free Food To Orlando Shooting Blood Donors"}
