Seinfeld's character, Barry B. Benson, tries to sue the human race for exploiting bees for their honey, with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's character -- the love interest, who is not a bee -- helping him with the case. The actor John Goodman voices the menacing opposition lawyer, Layton T. Montgomery.\nFor simultaneously baffling and obvious reasons, the movie has earned a cult following online. A popular prank in 2015 involved Facebook users posting the whole script to their profiles, causing mobile readers to have to scroll through to the end if they wanted to see the next post in their feeds. You can now even buy a T-shirt with the entire \"Bee Movie\" script printed on the front.\u00a0\nEarlier this month, Seinfeld finally acknowledged the resurgence in popularity of his animated movie during a Reddit AMA. To the disappointment of \"Bee Movie\" fans, the comedian said he probably wouldn't make a sequel. \"I considered it this spring for a solid six hours,\" wrote Seinfeld. \"I actually did consider it, but then I realized it would make 'Bee Movie 1' less iconic.\"\nA fair, but frustrating response.\nSo with an opportunity to get another take from Goodman while he promoted his more recent movie, \"10 Cloverfield Lane,\" The Huffington Post asked the actor if he was aware of what \"Bee Movie\" has become.\n\"No, I didn't know that,\" said Goodman. \"Good for Jerry.\"\nAnother fair, but frustrating response.\nAfter listening to a quick summarization of how the movie has gained a second wave in popularity from Tumblr,\u00a0Goodman added, \"Oh good. Great for Jerry.\"\nWell, at least he now knows what the internet has done.", "title": "John Goodman Had No Idea That 'Bee Movie' Was Popular Again"}
