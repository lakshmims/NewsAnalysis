Patterson examined news coverage from 2015, a period dubbed the invisible primary,\u00a0and found that Trump received an \"unusual\" amount of attention at time when there was little indication by way of polls that he could win.\u00a0\n\"Upon entering the race, he stood much taller in the news than he stood in the polls,\" Patterson wrote. \"By the end of the invisible primary, he was high enough in the polls to get the coverage expected of a frontrunner. But he was lifted to that height by an unprecedented amount of free media.\"\nThough Trump certainly received some negative coverage last year, Patterson found the media's heavy focus on him to be beneficial to his candidacy.\u00a0\n\"Trump\u2019s coverage was positive in tone\u2014he received far more \u2018good press\u2019 than 'bad press,'\" Patterson wrote. \"The volume and tone of the coverage helped propel Trump to the top of Republican polls.\"\nThe Shorenstein report cites data from Media Tenor, a firm that analyzes news coverage, and focuses on eight major news outlets: CBS, NBC, Fox,\u00a0The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and USA Today. Patterson found that each outlet's coverage of Trump was generally favorable.A lot of the favorable coverage stemmed from the media's tendency to focus on the campaign horserace instead of candidates' policy positions. More than half of the coverage of Trump was focused on the horserace and campaign activity, Patterson found, while \u201conly 12 percent of Trump\u2019s coverage addressed his issue stands and political beliefs.\u201d\nThe media\u00a0didn't adequately vet\u00a0Trump's business record and\u00a0failed to challenge some of his most persistent talking points, such as his demonstrably false claim that he\u00a0publicly opposed the Iraq War before it began.\nPatterson also looked at the Democratic contest, which \u201cgot less than half as much news exposure as the Republican race\u201d and really only picked up as presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) began to shrink late in the year.\nThough he was largely ignored early on, Sanders received the most favorable coverage of any Republican or Democratic candidate during his unlikely rise, according to the study. Meanwhile, Clinton got the least favorable coverage of any leading Republican or Democratic contender.\n\"Whereas media coverage helped build up Trump, it helped tear down Clinton,\" Patterson wrote. \"Trump\u2019s positive coverage was the equivalent of millions of dollars in ad-buys in his favor, whereas Clinton\u2019s negative coverage can be equated to millions of dollars in attack ads, with her on the receiving end.\"\nNews organizations gravitated toward the Trump phenomenon, Patterson concluded, because \"journalists are attracted to the new, the unusual, the sensational\u2014the type of story material that will catch and hold an audience\u2019s attention.\" \n\"Trump fit that need as no other candidate in recent memory,\" he wrote. \"Trump is arguably the first bona fide media-created presidential nominee. Although he subsequently tapped a political nerve, journalists fueled his launch.\"\nRead the full study here.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "New Report Proves What We Already Knew: The Media's Donald Trump Obsession Helped Propel His Candidacy"}
