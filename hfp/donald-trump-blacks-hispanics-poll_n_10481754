(Hillary Clinton reached a new high in the unfavorable stakes as well -- 55 percent.)\nYet even more striking is Trump's standing with people who are black and Latino --\u00a0growing voting blocks whose support is crucial to cobbling together a winning coalition. A staggering 94 percent of black voters view the real estate mogul negatively, as do 89 percent of Latinos, despite his predictions\u00a0that he will \"win the Hispanic vote\" in November.\nIt's not hard to see why.\nTrump wants to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. He's gone on a racist tirade against a federal judge of Mexican heritage, and his outreach to Latinos entails posing for a picture on Cinco de Mayo with a taco salad bowl. He initially refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, before later doing so. And he has significant backing from white supremacists, especially online, where they harass his critics with vile and racist attacks.\nThe reality TV personality has taken the 2012 GOP \"autopsy\" -- a set of recommendations the Republican National Committee released meant to broaden the party to minorities -- and completely blown it up. With five months to go until November, and no sign their presumptive nominee is willing to change his approach, it's difficult to see whether the Republican Party can repair its already low standing with non-white voters.\nThe Manhattan businessman's only play may be over-performing with whites and independents. Clinton's unfavorable with 75 percent of white people, 73 percent of whites with no college degree and 63 percent of independent voters, according to the Post/ABC poll. However, current polls show Trump isn\u2019t in a stronger position than Mitt Romney was in 2012 to pull in enough white voters to win.\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Here's More Proof That Black And Latino Voters Really Don't Like Donald Trump"}
