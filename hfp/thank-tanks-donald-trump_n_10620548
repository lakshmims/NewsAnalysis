Or were dialogue and engagement more likely to bring about positive change?\nDecades later, policy wonks face the same question about presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\u201cThis is not your normal \u2018Oh, we have a more extreme candidate.\u2019 This is a person who's unsuited and unqualified and frankly, undemocratic,\u201d said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution. \u201cI haven't heard of a single person from a major think tank joining the Trump team. That's very unusual.\"\nFor many of Mann\u2019s think tank colleagues -- and particularly for conservatives --engaging with Trump risks legitimizing him and his numerous controversial statements while simultaneously damaging their own reputations.\n\u201cThere's a lot of people who believe that Donald Trump is the most serious threat to American democracy we have seen in the modern era,\u201d Mann said. \u201cI think it will be very hard finding serious, honest experts [to] join in.\u201d\nOf course, experts hoping to isolate Trump have found a willing accomplice in Trump himself.\n\u201cHe just doesn't seem to be interested,\u201d said the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Ramesh Ponnuru. \u201cNothing he has done is suggestive of any interest in policy.\u201d\nBy this point in a presidential campaign, nominees have typically established alliances with like-minded think tanks. While the groups cannot endorse candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, their researchers provide the detailed analyses and intellectual heft that inform and support a candidate's policy proposals.\n\u201cIt's fairly clear, for the most part, the kinds of Republican experts who would be all on board with a presidential campaign at this point -- with task forces, and policy proposals and meetings and so forth -- are not,\u201d said Norm Ornstein, who is also with the AEI. \u201cYou could convene his policy team in a bathtub.\u201dTrump\u2019s campaign did not respond to The Huffington Post's requests for comment on this story. Over the months, the real estate mogul has downplayed his need for expert advice, citing his own\u00a0\u201cvery good brain\u201d\u00a0as evidence.\u00a0On dealing with the self-described Islamic State, for example, Trump said that he knew more about the terror group than the military commanders fighting it.\nPonnuru said his colleagues are divided on whether it's better to stay away from Trump or get close to him, but a consensus has emerged that Trump is not likely to take their advice anyway. \u201cThe prevailing sentiment is that he\u2019s going to do his thing, and he\u2019s going to continue to do his thing,\u201d Ponnuru said.\nTrump\u2019s attitude does offer the benefit of not having to justify the position of a candidate that you might not agree with, he conceded. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit liberating, being able to say you\u2019re completely independent from the nominee.\u201d\nOne notable exception has been Heritage Foundation economist Stephen Moore, who has been open about his support for Trump. Moore, a longtime proponent of supply-side theory, with its emphasis on lower taxes for investment income, is particularly pleased with Trump\u2019s tax proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a blockbuster. It\u2019s going to be the best tax cut plan since Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Moore, who hastened to point out that his views are his own, and do not represent the Heritage Foundation's position.\nMoore said he doesn\u2019t share Trump\u2019s views on trade policy or immigration, although he does understand why those messages have resonated with many Republican voters. \u201cIf Trump wins, there will be kind of a change in Republican dogma on both economic policy and foreign policy. No question about it,\u201d he said.\nBut even some beneficial influence is better than none, Moore argued. On trade, for example, Trump hasn't spoken about a 45 percent tariff on Chinese products ever since Moore and others advised him against it, he said. \u201cMost people I talk to are like, 'Oh my god, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re working with Trump. Maybe you can push him in a good direction.'\u201d\nYet that view is a lonely one. Helping Trump isn't easy, given his general lack of interest. And the groups that do lend their names to his cause should be prepared for scrutiny.The Center for the National Interest learned this firsthand when it hosted Trump's foreign policy speech in April. A researcher there was fired after writing\u00a0a blog post\u00a0that criticized the think tank's decision to host what he called a \u201cbooster rally\u201d for Trump. \nAnd the very day of the speech, Jacob Heilbrunn, the editor of the think tank\u2019s magazine,\u00a0wrote an article for Politico Magazine explaining his decision to invite Trump. Heilbrunn said that he wasn\u2019t signing up to support Trump, but was glad for the chance to hear his views. \u201cI think he is having a salutary effect in forcing open a long-overdue debate in the GOP over foreign policy,\u201d Heilbrunn wrote.\nMann, of Brookings, said it would be tempting for experts -- particularly at lesser-known think tanks -- to offer support in exchange for access in a potential Trump presidency. \u201cI don't doubt there will be some think tanks we've never heard of from which individuals emerge to advise Trump,\u201d he said.\nBut Mann hopes they'll avoid the temptation. \"This, in some ways, will be a test of whether individuals and organizations merit their labeling,\" he added.\nEditor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "Think Tankers Don't Get Trump"}
