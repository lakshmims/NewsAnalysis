Who doesn\u2019t love the image of a\u00a0big dusty space snowball\u00a0careening through the skies?\nUnfortunately, comets don\u2019t smell as ethereally lovely as one would hope. Scientists discovered in 2014 that at least one comet --\u00a067P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko-- gave off an odor reminiscent of rotten eggs, horse poop, ammonia (read: cat pee) and formaldehyde.But that didn\u2019t stop members of the Rosetta mission team --\u00a0the people responsible for landing a probe on the comet -- from asking UK-based scent firm The Aroma Company\u00a0to make a perfume based on the comet\u2019s fragrance.\nNew Scientist reporter Jacob Aron had the misfortune of testing out the new perfume. He described it as having a \u201csharp, unpleasant scent\u201d that he could feel \u201cas a physical presence inside my skull.\u201d As he smelled more and more, however, Aron started coming around to the scent, writing that it\u2019s \u201cnot actually as foul as my first impression led me to believe\u201d and that he could even detect \u201ca few floral notes.\u201d Either that, or the horrible stench was just starting to make him delirious.\u00a0\nUnfortunately \u2014 or maybe fortunately? \u2014 the fragrance doesn\u2019t appear to be available commercially at this point. The Rosetta team will be handing out postcards with the scent at London\u2019s Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in July.\nSince we haven\u2019t sniffed this stuff ourselves, we\u2019ll have to hold further judgment. But really, could it be much worse than perfume that smells like zombies?\u00a0\nH/T Gizmodo", "title": "This Perfume Could Make You Smell Just Like A Comet"}
