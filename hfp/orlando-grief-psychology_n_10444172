With this process comes a lot of pain -- for people in the Orlando community and beyond.\nFor many of us, what happened is deeply personal. I called Orlando home during my college years, making lifelong friends in the city that was host to an attack on Sunday.\u00a0Others have pointed to the ways gay clubs like Pulse serve as a refuge\u00a0for them in inhospitable communities. Some have described a shared\u00a0experience with gun violence and their struggle with its aftermath.\nBut you don't have to have a personal link to the tragedy to feel upset. In fact, your emotions are fundamentally human:\u00a0Pain as a result of a tragedy,\u00a0even if you're not involved,\u00a0is an uncontrollable psychological response.\n\"At the heart of this is vicarious trauma\"\nIt's difficult to make sense of something so senseless. When you can't, your psyche tries to do it for you.\u00a0This comes through reading information on the event and then expressing sadness in any way that feels cathartic.Research shows that following devastating news can take a major toll on mental health. But, in a way, you can't help but follow along.\u00a0Studies suggest the mind has a natural negativity bias, which compels you to pay closer attention to tragedies than uplifting news.\n\"At the heart of this is a process called vicarious trauma, which is what happens when you watch someone go through an experience like this on the news,\" David Kaplan, chief professional officer at the American Counseling Association, told The Huffington Post. \"It's distressing to watch this kind of suffering because you have no control over it.\"\nHuman connection also plays a role, Kaplan says.\u00a0Not only do people have a biological,\u00a0inherent understanding of suffering, but that connection runs deeper the more they see parts of themselves in the victims. For example, the shooting is likely to particularly resonate with someone who identifies with the LGBTQ community.\n\"If you relate to the person who was attacked in any way, you're going to grieve because it's also part of you,\" Kaplan explained. \"And that's perfectly normal and perfectly understandable.\"Additionally, Kaplan says you don't need to live close to Orlando to feel close to what happened. The effects are still the same even if you're 1,000 miles away.\n\"Research shows that it's stressful to watch people go through something like this,\" Kaplan said. \"Even if you're far removed or living somewhere else, you can still feel traumatized.\"\nIf you're feeling particularly upset over Sunday's tragedy, experts recommend reaching out to friends and family, exercising self-care and talking to a mental health professional if you need it.\u00a0But ultimately, the pain you may be experiencing is real -- but so will be the resilience that follows it.\n\"People are amazingly tough and resilient,\" Kaplan said. \"Human beings can and will recover from trauma eventually.\"\n\nIf you \u2014 or someone you know \u2014 need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the\u00a0National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you are outside of the U.S., please visit the\u00a0International Association for Suicide Prevention\u00a0for a database of international resources.\n", "title": "Here's Why You Feel Actual Pain Over The Orlando Shooting"}
