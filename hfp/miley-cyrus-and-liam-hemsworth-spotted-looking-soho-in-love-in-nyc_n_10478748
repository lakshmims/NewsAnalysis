The two entered the hotel together and even held hands.\u00a0\nThe actor wore black jeans and a black tee, with grey shoes and a maroon jacket. Cyrus' outfit was a bit more colorful; the singer wore a black tank, jean jacket, outrageous pants and her engagement ring.\u00a0Cyrus and Hemsworth have managed to dodge questions about their relationship fairly well for the past few months. They have yet to make an official announcement, but\u00a0a source close to the pair has stated\u00a0the couple is engaged, and Billy Ray Cyrus also recently hinted the two may be headed for marriage soon.\u00a0\n\"They\u2019re really happy together right now,\" Billy Ray said in an interview\u00a0with \"Today\" earlier in June. \"They know if they need a preacher, they\u2019ve found one.\"\u00a0\nCyrus' godmother, country singer Dolly Parton, also confirmed in March that the couple was definitely back on\u00a0after a split in 2013. Sounds like we know who to turn to for all the details when these two tie the knot.", "title": "Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth Spotted Looking So(Ho) In Love In NYC"}
