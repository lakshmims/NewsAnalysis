You know what that means: it's time to get meal planning. Figuring out what you're going to eat for the week not only makes your life easier -- one less thing to think about -- but it'll help you eat healthier and save money. So, let's get to it.\nThis week we're starting our mornings with a coconut granola -- serve it on top of yogurt with fresh fruit. For lunch and dinner we have chicken shawarma, chickpea dip and a zucchini bean salad. (We suggest doubling the recipes to get a little more mileage out of them.) Serve it all together one night and then build salads and sandwiches with the leftovers to mix it up for other meals. The zucchini bean salad makes a great healthy lunch on its own too, packed with protein thanks to the beans.\u00a0\nWe suggest mango energy balls for when your sugar craving hits because we all know that's inevitable. They'll give you all the satisfaction of something sweet, with none of the crash you get from sugar-filled treats. Sound good?\nWithout further ado, the recipes you need to be making ASAP.", "title": "Your Sunday Meal Plan: Get Through The Week With Shawarma And More"}
