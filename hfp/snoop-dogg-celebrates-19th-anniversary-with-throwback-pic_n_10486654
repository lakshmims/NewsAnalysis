Snoop Dogg and his wife Shante Broadus just celebrated their 19th wedding anniversary.\u00a0\nThe West Coast rapper posted one hell of a throwback pic on Instagram Tuesday to commemorate the occasion, writing, \"19 years today @bosslady_ent. Happy anniversary -- been a1 from day 1.\"The pair first met as high school classmates in Long Beach, California before tying the knot in June 1997.\u00a0They are parents to three children -- two sons and a daughter -- and welcomed their first grandchild in 2015.\u00a0\nBut it hasn't always been smooth sailing for the high school sweethearts. In 2004, Snoop\u00a0filed for divorce,\u00a0citing irreconcilable differences; he even publicly admitted to being unfaithful in the marriage. The pair later reconciled and in 2008, the\u00a0\"Drop It Like It's Hot\" rapper planned a surprise vow renewal for his wife that was captured on his reality show \"Snoop Dogg's Father Hood.\"In a 2008 interview with Larry King, Snoop told the host it took \"a whole lot of begging and pleading\" to get her back.\u00a0\n\"It was up to me to try to put it back together, because I\u2019m the one who said I didn\u2019t want to be a part of [the marriage]\u00a0no more,\" Snoop said.\u00a0\nIn spite of the ups and downs, the rapper said he knew in his heart that they were meant for one another.\u00a0\n\"There\u2019s a lot of roller coaster to a relationship. You know, we\u2019ve been together for 17 or 18 years. We\u2019ve been married for 10 years,\" he said at the time. \"But, at the same time, it\u2019s like, you know, some people in life are chosen for you. And I feel like we\u2019re chosen for each other.\"\u00a0\nHere's to hoping these two have many, many happy years of marriage ahead!\u00a0", "title": "Snoop Dogg Celebrates 19th Anniversary With One Hell Of A Throwback Pic"}
