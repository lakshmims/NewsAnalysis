Simpson murder trial in the deaths of her brother, Ron, and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole.\nShe's broken down over the loss of her brother; she's revealed disturbing courtroom moments that infuriated her; she's sent sarcastic messages to Simpson;\u00a0she's been candid and open about her pain; and, through it all, she has defiantly refused to refer to Simpson as anything other than \u201cthe killer.\u201d\nFor as much as you see this impassioned version of Goldman making public statements about the June 1994 killings and her outrage over Simpson's 1995 acquittal, it would be easy to characterize her as forever angry. However, as Goldman tells \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\", that's simply not the case.\n\"The misconception people have about me is that I am angry all the time, that I cry all day long, that I wake up and my day consists of how I can stick it to the killer,\" Goldman says. \"When they see me for a 10-second soundbite on television being upset about something, they assume that I am stuck in the same place I was 21 years ago.\"\u00a0\nThe reality is much different, she explains.\n\"The truth of it is, I'm a full-time, working, single mom to an incredible 12-year-old kid,\" Goldman says. \"I'm just a regular person who also just happens to have their private life publicized every so often.\"\u00a0\nIn those publicized moments when she's speaking out, Goldman's strong feelings tend to surface. And, likely, they always will.\n\"Every once in a while, you might see me complaining or being upset,\" she says. \"[I'm] advocating for something that's important to me.\"\nGoldman addresses another misunderstanding:\nWhat everyone keeps forgetting about the O.J. Simpson case, even now", "title": "Kim Goldman Insists Her Days Don't Revolve Around How She Can 'Stick It' To O.J. Simpson"}
