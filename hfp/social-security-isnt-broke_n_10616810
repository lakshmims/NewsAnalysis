In fact, they argue, the distinctly non-apocalyptic assessment from Social Security\u2019s nonpartisan actuaries shows that the country can easily afford to both restore the program\u2019s solvency and expand benefits. \nThe report's release isn't normally an occasion for policy pronouncements. But in a sign of how much attention the White House is giving the issue,\u00a0Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, a trustee of Social Security\u2019s trust funds, reiterated President Barack Obama\u2019s call for increasing Social Security benefits at a press conference announcing the release of the trustees report.\u00a0\n\"The first challenge is to ensure solvency for future generations of Americans,\" Lew said. \"At the same time, we should expand and finance improved Social Security benefits, particularly for the most vulnerable.\"\nCarolyn Colvin, acting Social Security Administration commissioner and another one of the Social Security trust funds\u2019 trustees, also spoke at the press conference, where she quoted from an Obama speech earlier this month in which the president revealed his support for increasing benefits.\nSocial Security is under some financial strain from the retirement of the large \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation. Starting in 2034, Social Security will only be able to pay 79 percent of promised benefits, unless Congress acts to increase the program\u2019s revenues or reduce spending. (Congress has never failed to address the program\u2019s funding gaps in the past.)\nThat shortfall will likely be a cause for concern in the coming years, but it is hardly the crisis that many prominent Republicans have made it out to be.\nFor example, former GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in March that \u201cSocial Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.\u201dIn reality, Social Security\u2019s costs are currently equal to 5 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product -- or the total value of goods and services produced -- and is expected to peak at about 6 percent of GDP.\nColvin drew attention to those figures at Wednesday\u2019s press conference.\n\u201cThat one-percentage-point increase to sustain Social Security is surely manageable,\u201d Colvin said.\nColvin also noted that the cost bump for the baby boomers\u2019 retirement is significantly less as a share of the economy than the increase in public spending it took to provide the baby boomers with public education in their childhoods.\nClosing the funding gap alone can be achieved without cutting benefits. A popular proposal to raise revenue for the program would involve\u00a0lifting the cap on earnings subject to Social Security taxes above its current level of $118,500\u00a0-- or eliminating the cap altogether.\nIt\u2019s a solution that would close the vast majority of the program\u2019s shortfall, and Obama has indicated he is supportive of the idea.\nProgressives argue that Social Security\u2019s main problem is not its solvency, but the adequacy of its benefits. Obama and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u00a0have both\u00a0come out in favor of expanding benefits.\nThere are already signs that benefits expansion will be an issue in the presidential race as Clinton seeks to distinguish herself from presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has broken from Republican orthodoxy with his vows to protect the program from cuts. In her speech on the economy on Tuesday, Clinton said Trump has \"no ideas how to... expand Social Security.\"\nAdvocates for benefits expansion point to mounting evidence that Social Security is at once more modest than analogous programs in other countries, and yet an increasingly vital source of retirement income for U.S. seniors.\nSocial Security replaces a smaller percentage of Americans\u2019 pre-retirement earnings than do comparable programs in all but a few other wealthy nations.The average Social Security retirement benefit was $15,943 a year in 2014. It\u2019s a small sum, but Social Security is now the main source of retirement income for some two-thirds of seniors, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities' analysis of official data.And with the decline of traditional pensions, the inadequacy of 401(k) accounts and erosion of other savings vehicles like home equity, that figure is likely to grow in the coming years.\u00a0\nIn addition to Lew and Colvin, progressive groups and elected officials piled onto the news of the trustees report to tout their plans to expand the program.\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has introduced legislation to increase benefits and improve the program\u2019s solvency, is credited by some observers for helping push the Democratic Party\u2019s mainstream figures\u00a0in a more progressive direction on the issue. Sanders responded to the trustees report by repeating the message that's been a key element of his stump speech during his campaign for president this cycle.\n\u201cIt is time to expand Social Security, not cut it,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cMillions of seniors, disabled veterans and people with disabilities are falling further and further behind on $10,000 or $11,000 a year [in] Social Security.\u201d", "title": "Social Security Still Isn\u2019t Broke, New Report Confirms"}
