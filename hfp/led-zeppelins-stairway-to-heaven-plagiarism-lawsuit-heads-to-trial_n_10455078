It was not immediately clear when Plant and Paige might testify.\nLarry Iser, an attorney who has represented the Beatles and Michael Jackson and is not directly involved in the case, said in a phone interview the opening riff in dispute, which features a minor key and a descending bass line, is a common musical device used on other hit songs.\nThose include the Beatles piece \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" Chicago's \"25 or 6 to 4\" and Led Zeppelin's own recording \"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You,\" Iser said.\nAttorneys for Led Zeppelin have argued the chord progressions cited in the civil lawsuit were so clich\u00e9d that they did not deserve copyright protection.\nBut Judge Klausner, in his decision in April, said a jury could find \"substantial\" similarity between the first two minutes of \"Stairway\" and \"Taurus.\"\n\"While it is true that a descending chromatic four-chord progression is a common convention that abounds in the music industry, the similarities here transcend this core structure,\" Klausner wrote. He added that a jury would need to assess the \"concept and feel\" of the two works.", "title": "Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway To Heaven' Plagiarism Lawsuit Heads To Trial"}
