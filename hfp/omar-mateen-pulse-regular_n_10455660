Agents investigating Mateen told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d they\u2019ve also heard accounts that he was spotted on dating apps for men, including Jack'd, Adam4Adam and Grindr.\nThe new details indicate that the attack on\u00a0Pulse nightclub\u00a0may not have been random, and that Mateen was actually well-acquainted with the club where he opened fire on Sunday morning, killing 49 people and wounding 53 others.\u00a0\nSeveral regular Pulse customers recalled seeing Mateen at the club at various times and described his behavior as erratic.\u00a0\n\u201cSometimes he would be there for a few weeks at a time, and maybe on the weekends, and then you wouldn\u2019t see him for a little while, then you\u2019d see him again and that\u2019s the way it kind of went,\u201d James Van Horn, a frequent visitor to Pulse, told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\nPulse security guard Estella Peterkin recalled having to kick Mateen out for bad behavior on several occasions.\u00a0\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Jack'd said it could neither confirm nor deny that Mateen had a profile with the app, but added that the business would cooperate with authorities. Grindr did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\nDavid Lesage, a spokesman for Adam4Adam, said a user told the company he had been in contact with Mateen least year through the app, but Lesage said the company couldn't verify that report since a conversation that old wouldn't still be stored on servers.\u00a0\nOfficials are also investigating Mateen\u2019s ties to terrorist groups. The New York-born gunman was fatally shot by police during Sunday\u2019s attack.\nThis story has been updated to include comment from Jack'd and Adam4Adam.", "title": "Orlando Shooter Was Reportedly Spotted Regularly At Pulse Nightclub, On Dating Apps"}
