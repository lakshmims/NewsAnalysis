The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 on Monday that the Texas version of that law is unconstitutional because the requirement is medically unnecessary and\u00a0\"places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre-viability abortion.\"\u00a0Tennessee also has three anti-abortion laws being litigated in the courts, and those cases were put on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case. At least two of those laws -- the admitting privileges requirement and a stipulation that most abortion clinics be turned into ambulatory surgical centers, or mini-hospitals -- are likely to fall as a result of Monday's ruling.\u00a0\nRepublicans swept into state legislatures in 2010 have enacted an unprecedented wave of abortion restrictions that have shut down dozens of clinics across the country. Many of these laws, instead of directly banning abortion, attempt to close clinics by making it logistically or financially impossible to operate. The Supreme Court effectively slapped down these so-called TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) in Monday's ruling in\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt.\u00a0\n\u201cWe conclude that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes,\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. \u201cEach places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion,\u00a0each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access,\u00a0and each violates the Federal Constitution.\u201dThe seven states with pending abortion cases are likely to be the first to feel the legal consequences of the decision. But the ruling may have a much broader impact on abortion laws across the U.S.\nFour more states --\u00a0Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Virginia -- have clinic regulations similar to the ones struck down in Texas, although those states haven't yet been challenged in court.\u00a0Missouri, North Dakota, and Utah also have admitting privileges-requirements that wouldn't likely withstand a future legal challenge.\u00a0\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned lawmakers\u00a0in her concurring opinion on Monday that these types of laws \"do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion\" and \"cannot survive judicial inspection.\u201d\u00a0", "title": "Supreme Court Abortion Decision Will Affect These States Next"}
