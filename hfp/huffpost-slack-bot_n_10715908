Log into your Slack account.\nMany offices use Slack these days to facilitate internal communication. But if yours isn't one of them, worry not. You can still\u00a0create a Slack login and either create a new team or find an existing team.\nOn desktop, Slack can be accessed through your browser or through the app from the iTunes store.\u00a0\n2. Click this button right here:It will take you to an authorization page.\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Click \"Authorize.\"\nIn order for you and your team to use the bot, you need to authorize HuffPost. Once you click \"authorize,\" anyone on your Slack team can access the bot using the command /huffpost -- just type it into any message input box in Slack.\u00a0\nYou'll know the authorization is successful when you are directed to The Huffington Post homepage.\u00a04. Open Slack, type /huffpost and voil\u00e0!\u00a0\nWhile typing /huffpost is the easiest, most straightforward and intuitive way to get your news, it's not the only command available. You can also type\u00a0/huffpost\u00a0homepage to see the latest headline, up until the last hour.\u00a0\nHere's an example:Typing\u00a0/huffpost [section name] will result in the latest headline from that specific section. A section could be anything from entertainment to style to politics.\u00a0\nSee an example below:If you forget which sections are available, type in\u00a0/huffpost list sections\u00a0for a full list.\u00a0\u00a0If you forget any of the commands, no worries! Simply type\u00a0/huffpost help\u00a0and you will get the below menu:It's important to keep in mind that our Slack bot is meant to deliver news to you per your request. Trying to break the bot\u00a0will likely be prevented by Slack.\u00a0When you type in a command too often in a short amount of time in the same Slack channel, the bot will not work due to Slack's anti-spam feature.\u00a0\nIf this does happen but you really do need very many headlines in a short amount of time, switching to another Slack channel or asking for a headline from a different HuffPost section should fix the issue.\nHope you enjoy our bot, we'd love to hear your thoughts!
