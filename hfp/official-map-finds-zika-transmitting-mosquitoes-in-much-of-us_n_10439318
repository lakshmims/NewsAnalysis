Microcephaly is marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.\nIn the United States, Zika has only been found in the territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThe mosquitoes, whose scientific names are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, were concentrated most heavily in the U.S. Southeast and Southwest, according to the CDC maps that break each state down to its individual counties.\nThe maps (tmsnrt.rs/1U5njHx and tmsnrt.rs/1U5nP8t) utilized data back to 1995, including information from the CDC, university researchers and local health departments.\nThe Asian tiger mosquito, which lives in semi-rural settings, was captured at least once in 40 states, while the yellow fever mosquito, which prefers urban areas, was found in 26 states, the CDC said.\nOverall, they were found in roughly a third of the 3,141 counties in the United States, it said.\n\"Accurate and up-to-date information for the geographical ranges of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in the United States is urgently needed,\" authors of a paper containing the maps wrote this week in the Journal of Medical Entomology.\nOn Thursday, the World Health Organization advised women living in areas where Zika is being transmitted to delay getting pregnant, advice already given by several countries where the virus is in widespread transmission.\nThe connection between Zika and microcephaly came to light last fall in Brazil, which has confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly it considers to be related to Zika infections in mothers.\n(Reporting by Sebastien Malo, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
