He wasn't even willing to say that Trump would not, as the presumptive nominee contended on Monday, have the authority to prohibit Muslims from entering the country if he were president.\u00a0\n\"That's a question about immigration law,\" Ryan said. \"And you can go into the 1952 Immigration and Naturalization [sic] Act to determine whether or not the president has that kind of discretion.\"\nFor a party that regularly fights against executive overreach, refusing to weigh in on a unilateral ban on Muslims is an incredible amount of latitude to give a presumptive presidential nominee.\nRyan was clear with reporters that he still believes such a move is counterproductive and antithetical to who we are as a nation.\n\"This is a war with radical Islam,\" Ryan said. \"It is not a war with Islam. Muslims are our partners. The vast, vast majority of Muslims in this country and around the world are moderate, they're peaceful, they're tolerant.\"\nBut gone was Ryan's willingness to directly call out Trump.\nWhen the speaker was asked for his reaction to Trump's comments on the Orlando shooting, his comments that American Muslims have been harboring terrorists, and his comments questioning whether President Barack Obama really wants to fight terrorism, Ryan saved his harshest criticism for the reporter making the query.\n\"That's a loaded question,\" Ryan said.\nWhen the speaker finally got down to the topic, he encouraged \"everyone, including our nominee,\" to work with the House GOP on terrorism and immigration. He mentioned that Republicans were repackaging a number of bills dealing with terrorism, and he noted that Congress had passed into law a measure with enhanced security measures for the country's visa waiver program.\nRyan also said there was an important distinction between Muslims and radical Islamic terrorists, but he didn't point out that the distinction seemed to be lost on Trump, who has accused the Muslim community of not reporting the Orlando shooter to authorities. \"For some reason, the Muslim community does not report people like this,\"\u00a0Trump said Monday.\nThe FBI investigated the shooter twice, and found no reason to keep him under surveillance.\nEditor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\n\u00a0", "title": "Paul Ryan Refuses To Call Out Trump For Renewed Muslim Ban Push"}
