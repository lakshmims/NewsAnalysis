What you didn't hear -- because it didn't air in full during the Tonys broadcast on CBS -- was his acceptance poem for Best Book of a Musical.\nIn that poem/rap, Miranda thanked \"Hamilton\" director Thomas Kail, orchestrator Alex Lacamoire, choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler, The Public Theater's Oskar Eustis, producer Jeffrey Seller, and actor Daveed Diggs. Most important, though, he spoke about his father,\u00a0Luis A. Miranda, who moved from Puerto Rico to the United States before his son was born.\n\"I was a manager at the Sears in Puerto Rico, and\u00a0I basically threw it all away to go to New York,\" Luis explained in an interview with Broadway Genius. \"[And] I didn\u2019t speak a lot of English. It made no sense, but it was what I needed to do.\"\nRead Miranda's poem in full below, and watch the magic above.\n\nThis envelope says Lin, but it\u2019s not entirely Lin\u2019s\u2019Cause when you work with Tommy Kail the best idea wins.When Alex finds a place to cut or Andy needs more bars,You can\u2019t think \u201cthis is mine\u201d; you can only think \u201cthis is ours.\u201dIs it ours or is it hours? Well, it\u2019s hours of rewritingYou talk Burr with Oskar and Jeffrey and keep ignitingThat spark into a flame. Make a mark,Arrange the frame, hit your target and change the game,Earn the hyphenate in your name.You let Daveed Diggs turn your couplet into a triplet.You give him the mic, he grips it and spits it, rips it and flips it.You turn back to this envelope that says you win.You think about your father and how scared he must have beenWhen he came to New York City and he didn\u2019t speak the languageSo you give Hamilton all his hunger, genius, and anguish,And you vanquish self-doubt by perfecting your lines of textAnd you call Tommy Kail and you say, \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nHungry for more \"Hamilton\"? Here is a roundup of every single time the musical won or performed at the 2016 Tony Awards.", "title": "Watch Lin-Manuel Miranda Thank His Dad In The Tonys Poem You Didn't See"}
