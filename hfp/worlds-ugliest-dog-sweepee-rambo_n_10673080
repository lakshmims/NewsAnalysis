It\u2019s less about making fun of the dogs and more about appreciating those pups that are a little, uh, unconventional-looking.\nAnd this year\u2019s winner was definitely unconventional-looking.Sweepee Rambo, a 17-year-old Chinese-crested chihuahua, took home the glory (and a $1,500 prize) Friday night, The New York Times reports.\u00a0She has competed in the contest three times previously but never won before now, according to ABC News.Her official contest bio describes her as a \u201cride or die chick\u201d and notes that she was rescued from a dog pound. It also says that the blue-eyed girl has become blind in her old age.\nSweepee Rambo's owner, Jason Wurtz, told ABC that he originally gave the little dog to his then-wife as a gift, but when they divorced, he wound up taking the dog because his ex thought she was too ugly (We kind of see why they split).\nShe took the crown from last year\u2019s winner, a spunky, short-spined mixed breed named Quasi Modo.\nCorrection: Due to a typo, a previous version of this story stated that the prize was $15,000. The prize is $1,500.", "title": "This Year's 'World's Ugliest Dog' Is Unconventionally Adorable"}
