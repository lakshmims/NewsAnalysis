In a way, they're business partners.\"Rather argued that the cable news networks' nonstop coverage of Trump's candidacy\u00a0helped catalyze his ascent to the Republican presidential nomination.\n\"I think there has been some media complicity in the rise of Trump. It's not the only factor, but it has been a factor of providing him so much airtime, and in some cases being complicit in arranging that airtime,\" he said.\nThe former anchor stopped short of recommending a cable news\u00a0\"blackout\" of Trump, but suggested that the networks should try to afford an equivalent amount of airtime to other candidates.\n\"The role of the journalist is to\u00a0be an adversary, so I think the defense is, make\u00a0an editorial judgment, make sure\u00a0you offer the same to the other\u00a0side,\" he said. \"I'm not sure you want to have\u00a0him live three times a day for\u00a0an hour and a half at a time.\"\nRather acknowledged that Trump is \"very media-savvy,\" particularly in making himself available to the cable news networks, and suggested that Trump purposely schedules press conferences and events when viewers are paying attention. Trump also conducts frequent television interviews, often via phone.\u00a0\nThis is one area in which the real estate mogul excels in comparison to his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, Rather said. And it could make it possible for Trump to defeat her in November.\n\"I'm of the belief, having covered politics for a long time, that people by and large go by the tone of the person,\" Rather said.\n\"People can come out of a Trump speech and say, 'What do you think about him saying, possibly rearming the Japanese with a nuclear weapon?' 'I don't know, I didn't hear all that clearly, but I like the guy.' That's tone, and Trump has mastered it,\" he went on. \"It's one reason that if you're a Democrat and want Hillary Clinton elected, you should be very, very afraid coming into November.\"\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Dan Rather Worries That The Media Has Become 'A Business Partner Of Donald Trump'"}
