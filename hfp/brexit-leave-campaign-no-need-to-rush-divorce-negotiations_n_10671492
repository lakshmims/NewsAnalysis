He said the new leader would make the decision about when to invoke Article 50 and start the formal process of leaving the EU.\nArticle 50 of the Lisbon Treaty states that after notification of a wish to leave the EU, the exiting member state has two years to negotiate a deal.\nElliott said the full settlement on Britain's exit would include all aspects of the relationship, including the British contribution to the EU, access to the single market, extradition agreements and so-called passporting for financial services.\n\"This is basically the full settlement on everything from our contribution to the EU - when that ends - and would also include access to the single market, it would have to include the status of certain agreements we have on extradition so there is a whole multiplicity of areas we have to cover,\" he said.\nWhen asked whether it would include \"passporting\" rights for financial services companies in Britain to operate in the EU, he said: \"Yes absolutely, it would be a full spectrum agreement covering everything to do with our relationship with the EU.\"\n\"There is no reason why a sensible arrangement couldn't be put in place for passporting to continue,\" he said.\nSince the result of the referendum became clear on Friday morning, more than a million people have signed a petition for a new EU referendum that would require a higher level of support for taking a decision on membership.\nBut Elliott said the referendum decision to leave the EU had been made by the British people and that it would be implemented.\n\"This is the decision that has been made - it is going to happen. There is no way of wriggling out of it,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Kate Holton and Digby Lidstone)", "title": "Britain's Vote Leave Says No Need To Swiftly Begin Formal EU Divorce Negotiations"}
