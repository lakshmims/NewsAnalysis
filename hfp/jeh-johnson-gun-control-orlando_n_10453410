The Orlando gunman had also once been on a terrorist watch list.\nLess than two weeks ago, President Barack Obama highlighted the potential for a tragedy like the Orlando shooting to happen, saying he couldn't limit access to firearms to people who have been placed on a no-fly list because of the influence of the National Rifle Association.\nThe most recent push to expand gun background checks -- which are widely supported by the general public -- failed in Congress in 2013 months after the Newtown elementary school shooting due to a Republican-led filibuster.", "title": "Jeh Johnson: Gun Violence Has Become A Matter Of Homeland Security"}
