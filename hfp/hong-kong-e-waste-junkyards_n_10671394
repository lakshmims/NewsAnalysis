There are heaps of old computer parts and monitors, some piled into old cardboard boxes meant for produce or stuffed into plastic bags.\u00a0Workers break apart the electronics to find valuable components that can be resold elsewhere.The HK01 report followed up on\u00a0research from the Basel Action Network, a U.S.-based NGO that fights the export of toxic materials. BAN attached GPS trackers to e-waste in the U.S. and found that recyclers were exporting the junk to other countries.\nIn Hong Kong's case, importing e-waste is actually illegal, Wired reported.\nBAN's project highlights how some American companies get away with being \"recyclers\" in name only, simply shipping the e-waste off to other countries to deal with.\n\"They take advantage of the fact that the U.S. is the only developed country in the world that has failed to ratify the Basel Convention, which requires getting permission from importing countries before you send them toxic wastes such as old electronic devices,\" Jim Puckett, head of BAN, told HuffPost on Friday.\u00a0The unsafe conditions at the junkyards where these materials are being handled are also alarming. Breaking down e-waste can be harmful to a person's health, not to mention the environment.\n\"Once the waste is in China, it's being broken down in primitive operations that release toxic metals like mercury -- which not only can immediately poison workers, but some of it will find its way back to us as air pollution in the upper atmosphere and then rain down on our lakes and rivers,\" Puckett told HuffPost.\nBAN has a program called e-Stewards\u00a0that holds recyclers accountable to the Basel Convention. Many areas lack certified programs, though -- the law doesn't require recyclers to participate.\n\"This is an international crime,\" Puckett said.\nJohn Zhou contributed reporting.\nSee more photos from the HK01 investigation below.", "title": "Inside Hong Kong's Toxic Gadget Junkyards"}
