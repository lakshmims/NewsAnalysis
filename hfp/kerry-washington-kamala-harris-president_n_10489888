She thinks California Attorney General Kamala Harris (D) would be a great choice.\nAs political fixer Olivia Pope on ABC\u2019s hit \u201cScandal,\u201d Washington has some experience with women running for president:\u00a0Last season\u00a0Pope was aiding the fictional former first lady's White House campaign.\nIn real life, the Emmy-nominated actress has been involved in politics for a number of years. She worked on then-Sen.\u00a0John Kerry's 2004 presidential race, serves\u00a0on the President\u2019s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, and has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u00a0in the 2016 contest.\nAt the United State of Women Summit\u00a0on Tuesday,\u00a0The Huffington Post asked\u00a0Washington,\u00a0\"How close do you think America is to being ready for a president who is a woman of color?\"\n\u201cWow! I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re in a really challenging place as a country right now,\u201d Washington said. \u201cSome of the rhetoric around women, around immigrants, around people of color is breathtaking to me.\u201d\n\u201cI think also there are a lot of us who are fighting for inclusivity and justice. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s in the next term, but maybe,\u201d she said.Asked if there are any women she'd like to see aiming for the White House, Washington said,\u00a0\u201cSomebody that I\u2019m a huge fan of, but she\u2019s running for Senate right now, is Kamala Harris in California.\u00a0I think she\u2019s extraordinary. I do think she could be president one day.\u201d\nHarris came in first in the primary\u00a0for California\u2019s open Senate seat earlier this month. She will compete against fellow Democrat Loretta Sanchez, a U.S. representative, during the general election in November.\nWatch our full interview with Kerry Washington here.", "title": "Kerry Washington: How About Kamala Harris For First Female President Of Color?"}
