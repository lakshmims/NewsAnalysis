We can make a great Olympics, but if some steps are not taken, it can be a big failure,\" Fransisco Dornelles told O Globo, according to CNN.\u00a0\nBrazil hasn't followed through on a promise to provide Rio with extra funding for security and transportation, according to Dornelles. Police officers in the city aren't being fully paid and may not even have enough money for gas.\nThe missing funds are just the tip of Brazil's iceberg of turmoil.\nCrime\nA functioning police force and transportation system are necessary, given the rising crime in Rio. Murder and robbery are up 15 percent and 30 percent, respectively, since last year,\u00a0NPR reports. The city is trying to get\u00a0new buses off the ground to help tourists avoid the favelas -- areas vulnerable to violence, theft and gang activity.\u00a0\n\"How are people going to feel protected in a city without security?\" Dornelles said.\nPolitical Unrest\nAfter months of protest from angry Brazilians, the Senate last month voted to impeach President Dilma Rousseff over allegations that she lied about the country's economic issues.\nRousseff and several members of her cabinet are also accused of\u00a0making billions off of the state-run oil company Petrobras.\u00a0\nWealth Gap\nEconomic inequality has long been an issue in Brazil. Recent figures indicate that the unemployment rate topped 11 percent last month. Wages are also down. Meanwhile, those involved in the Petrobras scandal are said to have made over $5 billion from bribes, kickbacks and money-laundering.\u00a0\nThe Worst Recession In Decades\nBrazil is facing one of the worst recessions the country has ever faced.\u00a0The economy shrank 5.4 percent in the first three months of the year, the government said.\u00a0Additionally, as FT points out, export prices have shrunk, household debt has increased, and inflation has risen even more than expected.\u00a0\nZika Fears\nThe recent outbreak of the Zika virus has lead to athletes, journalists\u00a0and other travelers vowing to skip the August games.\nAlthough the symptoms of Zika aren't serious, the virus can lead to severe birth defects\u00a0if contracted by a pregnant woman.\n\"Female athletes should not be forced to make a decision that could sacrifice the health of a child,\" soccer star Hope Solo\u00a0said.\nThere are currently\u00a0no effective treatments\u00a0or\u00a0vaccinations.", "title": "Rio's Leader Warns That The Olympics Could Be A 'Failure'"}
