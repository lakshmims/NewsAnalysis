Having a live stream, and then a recorded version, allows BroadwayHD to entice fans with big names like Krakowski long after the actual show's final curtain drops.\nOf course, the news of one Broadway show's live stream makes one naturally speculate whether other big-name productions might go the same route. Perhaps, even, one little-known musical about a 10-dollar founding father without a father?\nWhile everyone went nuts for the selection of \"Hamilton\" tunes performed live at the White House in March, it's unlikely that a crazy-popular show -- with, we imagine, a long life ahead of it on Broadway\u00a0-- will be available for public streaming anytime soon.\nIf you make like Aaron Burr and wait for it, you'll probably be waiting a little longer.\u00a0\nCatch \"She Loves Me\" live on Broadway HD on June 30 at 8 p.m. ET.\u00a0", "title": "'She Loves Me' To Be The First Live Streamed Broadway Show"}
