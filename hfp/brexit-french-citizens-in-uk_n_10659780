Economists in favor of Brexit have said that European migrants represent a huge burden to the British economy -- a claim\u00a0could be used to restrict family allowances for non-British Europeans.\nA version of this piece was originally published on HuffPost France, and has been translated into English and adapted for a U.S. audience.\u00a0", "title": "What Does Brexit Mean For French Citizens In The UK?"}
