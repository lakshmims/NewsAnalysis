The district the nine candidates are vying for runs from the southern to the northern border of Tennessee and includes Chattanooga and Oak Ridge, where most of the population is concentrated.\u00a0\n\"It's pretty diverse,\" Kersting said. \"Chattanooga has a significant minority population. The rest of the district is heavily white.\"\nKersting admitted he doesn't have a chance in the race against the heavily favored and well-funded incumbent: He's running because being on the ballot gives him a bigger voice on issues like bipartisanship and moderate gun control.\nTyler, he said, has an equally long shot at victory.\u00a0Tyler ran for a Senate seat in 2014 as an independent and got 0.4 percent of the vote with about 5,700 ballots.\u00a0\n\"The best thing is that Rick Tyler has zero chance of getting elected,\" Kersting said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really hopeful the people in the district don\u2019t give him too much attention,\" he said, adding that Tyler's ideas, though they appeal to a minority of voters, are \"less marginal than I would like.\"\u00a0\n\"There will be some people who will latch on to his ideas,\" Kersting said. \"Unfortunately, with Trump in the race, there\u2019s nothing discouraging that.\"", "title": "Tennessee Congressional Candidate Has A Dream To 'Make America White Again'"}
