Well, guess again. Some of these well-intentioned food swaps are not having their intended effect. In fact, they are actually making those jeans get just a little tighter. \u00a0Here\u2019s the truth behind these supposedly healthy switcheroos.\nBad Swap #1: Granola for Cereal\n\u201cPeople think granola has this halo effect, that it has to be healthy. However, not all granolas are alike. It can be loaded with sugar or fat, and one cup can carry 400 calories,\u201d cautions Joan Salge Blake, M.S., R.D.N., author of Nutrition and You, and Clinical Associate Professor, Boston University. Read your labels and compare sugar, salt, and fat amounts. (Recommended daily allowances for all three can be found at Health.gov.)Kind granola brand has been getting good marks from nutritionists and sites like Eat This, Not That!, which praises the product's long list of healthful whole grains. Better yet, start your morning with a cup of low-sugar whole-grain cereal. If you want, lightly sprinkle granola on top for added crunch and flavor.\nBad Swap #2: Pretzels for Potato Chips\nThey are calorically the same so you aren\u2019t doing yourself any favors. \u201cYour best bet for this kind of snack is popcorn because it is a whole grain,\u201d says Salge Blake. Instead of drowning the popcorn in melted butter, sprinkle it with spices, spice blends that don\u2019t contain salt, or brewer\u2019s or nutritional yeast.\nBad Swap #3: Wheat Bread for White Bread\nYou need to read the labels and make sure that the bread contains 100 percent whole wheat. \u201cWheat bread, without the whole wheat ingredient, could be processed and refined with added caramel for color. That\u2019s as unhealthy as white bread,\u201d says Salge Blake. When choosing bread and cereals look for whole grain or whole wheat as the first ingredient. \u00a0Whole grains are richer in nutrients and fibers, and satisfy sooner. Also, a new study published in in the American Heart Association's journal \"Circulation\"\u00a0shows that eating at least three servings of whole grains every day could significantly lower your risk of death.\nBad Swap #4: Fat-Free Candy for Dark Chocolate\n\u201cA lot of people confuse fat-free with calorie-free, when in fact, fat-free products can be high in sugar,\u201d says Bonnie Taub-Dix, M.A., R.D.N., C.D.N., author ofRead it Before You Eat It, and founder/owner ofBetterThanDieting.com. Furthermore, recent studies have blamed excess dietary refined sugar for an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease and more. If you need a sweet fix, try a small but satisfying piece of dark chocolate that you take time with. Studies have posited that it may come with certain health benefits such as lowering blood pressure, reducing blood clot risks, and decreasing LDL (\u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol oxidation.\nBad Swap #5: Olive oil for Butter\nYes, olive oil is healthier for you than butter (which is higher in saturated fat), but calorie-wise, it weighs in at 2000 calories a cup. \u00a0\u201cWhen you are cooking with oil, if you use a \u00bc cup of oil, that\u2019s 500 calories on probably 50-calorie vegetables,\u201d points out Taub-Dix. \u00a0Bottom line: Don\u2019t think you can just mop up as much as you want of either with your bread. You have to watch your quantities for calories with butter and oil. Opt instead for flavoring with herbs and spices. Better yet, use mashed avocado as a source of fat; they are loaded with monounsaturated fat, the \u201cgood\u201d kind that helps lower \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol. You can bake with it or use in place of mayonnaise and butter in salad dressing.\nBad Swap #6: Vitamin Drink for Soda\nSound the foul buzzer \u2013 both answers are wrong. Both are will cause you to pack on the pounds and can strip your energy, because they are so high in sugar. The added vitamins may entice you, but the health benefit is not worth the calorie hit. Replace with calorie-free flavored or plain water; if you need the caffeine boost, drink unsweetened iced tea. Taub-Dix also recommends making a \u201cmock\u201d sangria by adding fresh fruit to seltzer. \u201cYou\u2019ll get an energy boost by eating the fruit at the end,\u201d she says.\nBad Swap #7: Energy Bars for a Sandwich\nIf you are searching for healthful on-the-go snacks, think twice about those energy bars. They can have loads of calories and added sugar. Instead, pack an almond butter sandwich on whole grain. \u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper, doesn\u2019t need refrigerator and has a lesser amount of sugars,\u201d says Taub-Dix. Plus, almond butter and whole grains provide filling protein and fiber for a long-lasting energy boost.\nRead more from Grandparents.com:\n5 Miracle Foods You Actually Want to Eat\n5 Easy Ways to Decrease Your Portion Sizes\n7 Foods That Make You Hungrier\n\u00a0", "title": "7 Food Swaps That Are Making You Overweight"}
