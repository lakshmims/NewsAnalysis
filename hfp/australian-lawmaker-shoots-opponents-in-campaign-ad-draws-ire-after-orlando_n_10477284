Australia is set to hold national elections on July 2.\n\"I'm not giving an explanation. You can go and watch the advertisement because it's an anti-selling off Australia advertisement,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\"It was just for humor value. But it was humor getting a message across.\"\nThat argument did not seem to gain much traction on Twitter, where users savaged Katter.\n\"Wouldn't be a real election without Katter doing something weird or borderline insane,\" Twitter user Samuel McAuliffe wrote.\n\"So Bob Katter decides that now would be a really good time to release a video showing him shooting people dead,\" tweeted @GordonlKnight.", "title": "Australian Lawmaker Shoots Opponents In Campaign Ad, Draws Ire After Orlando"}
