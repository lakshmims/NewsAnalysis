He could not immediately say how Jones eluded the guard detail.\n\"Our focus right now is bringing the inmate into custody. How he got away will be determined at a later date,\" Graves said.\nIt is unclear if Jones is still wearing the white inmate uniform he had on when he escaped, according to Graves, who said investigators were trying to determine whether Jones knew anyone in the area.\nJones has multiple tattoos, including depictions of a dragon, a wizard and a skull, according to the website for the Department of Corrections.\nAnother inmate at an Arkansas prison had attempted to escape two months ago. That inmate was shot and killed shortly after leaving the secure fence, according to CNN.", "title": "Convicted Killer Lloyd Jones Escapes From Arkansas Prison"}
