Aracena-Montero,\u00a0Simon Adrian Carrillo Fernandez,\u00a0Juan Ramon Guerrero,\u00a0Eric Ivan Ortiz-Rivera,\u00a0Peter O. Gonzalez-Cruz...\nThese names, along with many others that belong to the 49 victims killed in Orlando at Pulse on Sunday, all seem to have at least one thing in common: Latino heritage. After all, it was \"Latin night\" at the nightclub the evening of the massacre.\nAnd some in the Latino community, including \"My So-Called Life\" alum Wilson Cruz, have asked that the media not forget that this tragedy was,\u00a0in many ways,\u00a0\"a direct attack on LGBT Latinos\" and it should be reported as such.\u00a0\n\u201cNaming those names and where they\u2019re from and the struggle that they were living daily as LGBT Latinos is part of the story and not naming it, to me, feels like erasing a large part of who they are and their experience,\" Cruz, who lost a family member in the shooting, told The Huffington Post. \"Let\u2019s not whitewash their experience, it\u2019s multi-faceted.\u201d\nWith that in mind, we visited the memorial at Stonewall in New York City's West Village and asked LGBTQ Latinxs and their allies to write a message in honor of the lives lost in Orlando.\u00a0Here's what they had to say:\u00a0In his interview with HuffPost, Cruz also had a message of his own for any young LGBTQ Latinxs who are afraid to be who they are because of the tragedy:\n\nI don\u2019t know that there is anything that I could say that is going to take the pain away but I can tell you this: I hope they find some refuge and some comfort in knowing that they are members of a long line of LGBT Latino people that have fought their entire lives, generation after generation, for our right to live the lives that we live now...\u00a0And while the pain that they feel right now and the fear that they feel right now is very real, their responsibility is to feel it, to understand it, to never forget it but to use it so that the young people who come after them won\u2019t have to deal with fear in the same way. Because that\u2019s what people did for them, and that\u2019s what people did for me.\n\nDonate to Orlando here:\u00a0", "title": "LGBTQ Latinxs And Allies Share Heartfelt Messages In Honor Of Orlando Shooting Victims"}
