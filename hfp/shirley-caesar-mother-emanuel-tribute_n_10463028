Friday will mark the one-year anniversary of the deaths of the parishioners who were killed during bible study, and\u00a0a number of events have been scheduled to take place in memoriam.\u00a0\u00a0\nCaesar will join keynote speaker Rev. Dr. Bernice King for a special performance during the Mother Emanuel Tree Dedication ceremony on June 18.\nThe historical black church, where Caesar said she received her very first honorary doctorate degree \"35 years ago,\" also inspired the recording of \"Mother Emanuel\" for her latest album, \"Fill This House.\"\nFor Caesar, recording the tribute ballad was therapeutic as it reminded her of a time in her life when she had difficulty coming to grips with forgiveness.\n\"I remember before the Lord saved me, that I had difficulty in forgiving people,\" Caesar said to The Huffington Post. \"I felt like whenever people did me wrong the first thing I\u2019d say to myself, and I say to them, 'I don't deserve this' and those people [the victims] did not deserve that. And it took me at least two weeks to forgive that boy [Dylann Roof,] for doing what he did to those nine people.\"\nRoof is currently awaiting the start of his federal trial in November, where he\u2019s facing the death penalty for a list of hate crime charges.\nCaesar went on to add that in addition to her tribute performance this month, she's also \"very interested\" in filming a music video for \"Mother Emanuel.\"\nTo coincide with the release of \"Fill This House\" and \"Mother Emanuel,\" the 11-time Grammy Award winner has also been named to receive a star on Hollywood\u2019s prestigious Walk of Fame as this year marks her 50 year anniversary as a solo artist.\nCaesar, who is considered by many as the \u201cFirst Lady of Gospel Music,\u201d\u00a0says that she\u2019s grateful to have gone \u201cthrough the many, many changes\u201d of Gospel music to a more secular sound to attract a younger audience, but in the future she would like to see the genre evolve to benefit the elderly, too. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cAll of the radio stations need to know that we have a lot of the elderly people who love gospel music, so don\u2019t just play contemporary music, but reach back and get some of the other music and play those,\u201d she said. \"It'll be a blessing to moms and grandmothers and grandfathers, because we need to keep them right there in our hearts and in the forefront.\"\nCheck out the lyric video for Shirley Caesar's \u201cMother Emanuel\u201d in the clip below.", "title": "Gospel Legend Shirley Caesar On Her Tribute To Charleston Church Victims"}
