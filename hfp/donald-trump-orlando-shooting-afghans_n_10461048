Born in New York City, he had little connection to the war-torn country of his immigrant parents.\nTrump claimed, falsely, that Mateen was\u00a0\u201cborn an Afghan of Afghan parents\" in a speech Monday afternoon.\u00a0\u201cThe bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America was because we allowed his family to come here,\u201d Trump, who also renewed his call to\u00a0ban Muslims from traveling to the United States, said.\u00a0\nMateen\u2019s U.S. citizenship was \u201cessentially wiped away\u201d once his Afghan roots and a last-minute pledge of allegiance he made to the so-called Islamic State were revealed, Kabul-born and California-raised journalist Ali Latifi wrote Sunday in an op-ed for Media Diversified.\n\u201cAs much as the media may want to orientalize this story by focusing on a country Mateen had never been to and a religiosity that is debatable that he adhered to, the truth is, the Orlando shooting only comes down to two things: gun control and homophobia,\u201d Latifi continued.When news broke of the mass shooting, Rezwan Natiq, who heads a non-governmental social organization in Kabul, Afghanistan, was watching CNN at home.\nHe watched in horror as grim footage emerged of wailing family members and bloodied survivors. And as the death toll continued to rise, Natiq found himself praying that the attacker didn\u2019t kill in the name of Islam.\nWhen it emerged that the gunman was an American citizen whose parents had emigrated from Afghanistan, like so many others had after the 1979 Soviet invasion, Natiq\u2019s heart sank.\n\u201cWhen I heard he was a Muslim with Afghan roots, I felt so annoyed,\u201d Natiq told The WorldPost just after breaking his Ramadan fast at sundown. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018How could he do this?\u2019\u201d\nNatiq knew what would come next.\nAs Orlando reels and the nation grieves what is being called the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history and the worst ever attack on the country\u2019s gay community, great focus has been placed on Mateen\u2019s family history and religion.\u00a0CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour pressed Afghan President Ashraf Ghani Monday on the Afghan ancestry of the shooter, who has been described as angry, confused and violent by those who knew him. While Ghani slammed the attack as a \u201cheinous [and] unforgivable crime,\u201d he stressed that the shooter was raised in the United States, not Afghanistan.\n\u201cAn individual cannot represent a culture or civilization,\u201d Ghani said in response to news of Trump renewing his call for a U.S. travel ban on Muslims and people from countries with a history of terrorism.\nSome Afghans are worried that Afghans and Afghan-Americans are being painted as could-be terrorists.\n\u201cThere are thousands of other Afghans who have been serving America and American people without threatening U.S. security,\u201d Shaheedulla Mubariz, an economics professor at a university in Kabul, told The WorldPost by phone.\nMany Afghans who served as interpreters and support staff for U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 2001-2014 are still trying to seek asylum in the United States, in fear of their lives. The Taliban is known to murder those perceived as loyal to the United States.\u00a0\nMubariz said he watched news of the mass shooting with a heavy heart alongside his colleagues, upset that so many had lost their lives and worried that it would only further taint U.S. views of Afghans and of Muslims.\n\"If you kill a person, it means you kill all humanity,\u201d Mubariz said. \u201cIslam is a religion of peace. Everyday we say, 'Peace be upon you.' People violate the Islamic rules, but that\u2019s not Islamic.\u201dAlthough many Afghans abroad and in the U.S. have slammed the media and public for focusing on Mateen\u2019s Afghan roots and diverting attention from issues like gun control, one Afghan-American writer, Fariba Nawa, said in an article for PRI\u2019s The World that the shocking attack presents the community with an opportunity to address real concerns like homophobia.\n\u201cMy social media feed is filled with soul-searching from Afghan-Americans, and apologies to LGBTQ people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut it\u2019s also filled with denial and deflection: 'He was just a lone wolf, a mentally ill lunatic, and there\u2019s no need for Afghans to even acknowledge his heritage. If a white man commits the crime, all white Americans don\u2019t take responsibility. Why do we have to?'\u201d\n\u201cOne way we can prevent more members of our community from becoming gun-toting killers is to confront our demons of homophobia and religious intolerance,\u201d she continued.\nThe gunman's father, Seddique Mateen,\u00a0has been criticized for\u00a0a series of rambling political videos in which he occasionally praises the fiercely anti-U.S. Taliban. But he has also voiced pro-American sentiments and referred to the United States as his \"home.\"\nAnd even he has been eager to downplay his son's connections to Afghanistan.\u00a0\u201cOmar was an American and not an Afghan-American,\u201d the elder Mateen told The Guardian.\u00a0\u201cHe was born in the US and never went to Afghanistan. He attended school here, worked here and his whole life was here.\"\nSophia Jones reported from New York.
