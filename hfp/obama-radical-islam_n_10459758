What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this?\u201d Obama asked rhetorically, using another name for the Islamic State. \n\u201cThe answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away.\u201d\nPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u00a0accused Obama of being weak for refusing to describe Orlando shooter Omar Mateen and the perpetrators of last year\u2019s shooting in San Bernardino, California,\u00a0as part of the threat posed by\u00a0\u201cradical Islam.\u201d\u00a0Trump used Sunday\u2019s tragedy as an opportunity to take credit for his previous pledge to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., and he reiterated that proposal in the wake of the shooting -- even though Mateen was born in Trump\u2019s home state of New York.\nAfter Trump's pestering, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton broke from her earlier stance. She said Monday that she is \u201chappy to say\u201d the phrase \"radical Islamism\" because it means the same thing as \u201cradical jihadism,\u201d a term she has used in the past. \nBut Obama stood firm. \u201cNot once has an adviser of mine said, 'Man, if we really use that phrase, we\u2019re gonna turn this whole thing around.' Not once,\u201d he said. \nCiting Republican lawmakers\u2019 refusal to vote on gun control reforms that would limit access to military-grade weapons -- and to confirm Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam Szubin -- Obama said the GOP's fixation on the term \u201cradical Islam\u201d was a \u201cpolitical distraction\u201d from their own inaction.Without mentioning the reality star by name, Obama homed in on Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S., warning of \u201csloppiness about who, exactly, we are fighting.\u201d \nNoting that both Mateen and Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino shooters, were U.S.-born citizens, Obama questioned whether Trump would eventually resort to treating Muslim Americans differently as well,\u00a0possibly subjecting them to extra surveillance or discriminating against them based on their religion. \n\u201cWhere does this stop?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cDo Republican officials actually agree with this?\u201d Obama continued, directly challenging Republican leadership to take a stand against Trump\u2019s toxic proposals. \nCircling back to his rejection of the term \u201cradical Islam,\u201d the president warned against rhetoric and policies that make Muslim Americans feel like they are constantly under suspicion. \n\u201cWe have gone through moments in our history before when we acted out of fear, and we came to regret it,\u201d he said.\nClarification: This article has been updated to reflect that Hillary Clinton used the phrase \"radical Islamism\" on Monday, and not the exact phrase \"radical Islam.\"\nEditor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Obama Excoriates Republican Obsession With The Term 'Radical Islam'"}
