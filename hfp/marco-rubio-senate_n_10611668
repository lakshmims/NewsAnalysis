Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday he would run for re-election, after previously stating he would return to private life after his current term ended.\nRubio announced his decision just ahead of Florida's June 24 filing deadline.\nThe senator, who ran a failed campaign for president this year, said in March\u00a0that he would not run for re-election to the Senate,\u00a0nor for governor of Florida in 2018.\n\nHe has even spoken about his displeasure with his time in the Senate.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that \u2018hate\u2019 is the right word,\u201d Rubio told\u00a0The Washington Post in October. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated.\u201d\nRubio acknowledged the change of heart while announcing his re-election bid.\u00a0\u00a0\nRubio said in\u00a0a statement announcing his decision\u00a0that he found the prospect of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the White House \"worrisome.\"\n\"It is no secret that I have significant disagreements with Donald Trump. His positions on many key issues are still unknown,\" Rubio said. \"And some of his statements, especially about women and minorities, I find not just offensive but unacceptable.\"\nFlorida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a friend of Rubio's who had been campaigning for his Senate seat, told Rubio on June 12 that he should reconsider running in the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, according to Politico:\n\nLopez-Cantera made clear he was still fully committed to running, even as he initiated a gut-check moment for both of them. Until then, Rubio had resisted the entreaties of Senate leaders and donors to rethink retiring from the Senate. Lopez-Cantera\u2019s conversation removed one of the biggest obstacles to Rubio running again: a longtime friendship that he wouldn\u2019t want to ruin due to political ambition.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure,\u201d Rubio responded.\nBut Lopez-Cantera says he felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to continue talking it through. The two of them were shaken by what they saw in Orlando, the bloody sidewalks and the ashen faces of local, state and federal authorities.\n\nRep. David Jolly (R-Fla.), who had also been running for Rubio's seat, announced on Friday he was\u00a0dropping out of the race, saying he would focus instead on a re-election bid for the House. Jolly had said he would step aside if Rubio ultimately ran for re-election.\nCNN reported in May that top Republican officials who worried the party might lose Rubio's seat to Democrats in 2016 had encouraged the senator to run for re-election.\u00a0Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) told reporters he thought it \"would be a great idea\" for Rubio to run again.\n\"I think it's as close to universal as you can get around here,\" Cornyn said of Senate Republicans' view on the matter.\nRubio launched his\u00a0presidential campaign in April 2015 and\u00a0dropped out of the race\u00a0in March 2016, after losing the GOP primary in his home state to Trump.", "title": "Marco Rubio Decides To Run For Senate Again"}
