Experts predict the decision to leave the EU will leave Britain poorer, take a heavy toll on British charities\u00a0and strain the \"special relationship\" between the UK and the United States. And that's just the start of it.\nIn the meantime, allow John Cleese -- who actually supported Brexit -- to make you smile.", "title": "UK Silly-Walks Off A Cliff In New Yorker's Monty Python-Inspired Brexit Cover"}
