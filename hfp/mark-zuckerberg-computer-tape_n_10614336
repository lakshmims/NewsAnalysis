He apparently covers the camera, possibly out of concern for his own security.\nThe Facebook CEO took to the social network to celebrate 500 million Instagram users by sharing a photo taken at the Facebook headquarters in California. In the photo, his desk and laptop are visible -- and so are a couple pieces of strategically placed tape.\u00a0An eagle-eyed viewer named Chris Olson, who currently works for a software startup called Replicated, spotted the interesting tidbits on Zuckerberg's hardware.\u00a0Gizmodo noted that it is almost certainly Zuckerberg's desk, as it appears to be identical to the desk he showcased in a tour during his first Facebook Live video back in October -- sunscreen, books and all.\u00a0\n\"When I first saw the photo I quickly noticed tape covering the camera,\" Olson told The Huffington Post. \"I\u2019ve actually seen this technique used a decent amount of times and knew it was used as the last line of defense for someone hacking your camera.\"\n\"I don\u2019t tape my own computer\u2019s camera and mic but after seeing someone like Mark, who leads a world-class technology company, I might just run down the street and pick some up,\" Olson added.\nSo, yes,\u00a0the Facebook billionaire might be a teeny, tiny bit paranoid. Can you blame him?\u00a0", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Covers His Laptop Camera With Tape"}
