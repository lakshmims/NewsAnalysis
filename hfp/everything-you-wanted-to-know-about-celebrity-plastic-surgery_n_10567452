The results of this procedure left most of Hollywood looking \"altered,\" and he added that because of this, people were \"starting to look weird.\"\u00a0The \"new face,\" he said,\u00a0resulted in a homogenous look among stars.\nNow, the doctors say the trend for celebrities is just to look like a better, perhaps more youthful version of themselves\u00a0instead of all looking alike.\u00a0A lot of celebs aren't having surgery, but are still having work done.\nWhile you might hear certain celebs claiming they've \"never gone under the knife,\"\u00a0Dr. Nassif explained that a lot of celebrities are doing non-invasive treatments that don't require surgery.\u00a0CoolSculpting, also known as cryolipolysis,\u00a0is one of those procedures. It freezes the body's fat and requires very little recovery time. The Kardashians did it this season on \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\"\u00a0\nMeanwhile, Dr. Dubrow told HuffPost that almost everyone in Hollywood is \"clearly\" having fillers, like Restylane and Juv\u00e9derm, injected. Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian recently admitted to getting fillers\u00a0while talking to him on her short-lived talk show \"Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9.\"\u00a0\nThese days, there's less shame associated with cosmetic surgery. It's becoming more common for celebrities to be more open about the procedures they've had done.\nIn terms of actually\u00a0admitting to certain surgeries, both doctors agree there's an evolution of admitting to \"acceptable\" procedures.\u00a0\n\"Celebrities will [admit to] breast implants now, but they wouldn\u2019t for a while,\" Dr. Dubrow said, citing rapper Iggy Azalea's recent carefree admission to having breast augmentation\u00a0as an example. \"Liposuction was verboten to admit to. Now, they will say, \u2018I had a little something sucked out.'\"There are still some procedures and surgeries that no one will admit to undergoing.\u00a0\nAccording to Dr. Dubrow, butt augmentation is still considered too taboo for celebrities to cop to having. Attitudes toward plastic surgery are constantly changing. Similar to liposuction now, he said we'll likely see evolution of butt augmentation becoming \"acceptable\"\u00a0in about four years.\u00a0\nAlmost \"every single\" female celebrity, \"by and large,\"\u00a0has given her nose \"a tweak.\" Seriously, everyone.\u00a0\n\"At the end of the day I think female celebrities, by and large, all mostly have had their noses done,\" Dr. Dubrow told HuffPost, while Dr. Nassif nodded in agreement. \"Even the ones who had cute little noses, they had a tweak. Almost every single one, including the major young one right now. I\u2019m not gonna say names, but [they] clearly had it done.\"\u00a0\nKylie Jenner and her lips are setting the course for plastic surgery trends right now.\u00a0\u00a0\nA few months before the reality star turned 18, she finally ended the speculation and admitted she had lip injections\u00a0(And once she was finally was old enough to vote, Jenner got down to specifics with the New York Times, revealing that\u00a0she uses Juv\u00e9derm and goes to Dr. Ourian in Beverly Hills). Now, the beauty maven can't stop talking about it and has caused more than a few copycats.\u00a0\n\"The biggest thing now is young girls in their early 20s and their late teens are getting lip fillers everywhere,\" Nassif said, while also adding that more and more women are getting fillers in their face.\u00a0Young girls copying Jenner has led to a \"disturbing\" plastic surgery trend. \u00a0\nBefore Jenner announced she'd added fillers to her beauty routine, Dr. Dubrow said the American Society of Plastic Surgery never approved doing fillers in someone so young. But after the 18-year-old's announcement, the procedure saw a serious uptick in popularity and suddenly became less taboo -- a trend the doctor described as \"disturbing.\"\n\"The American Society of Plastic Surgery is going 'Oh, it's OK now,\" because it means dollars in our pockets,\" Dr. Dubrow said. \"I just think that's uncool.\"\u00a0Tune into the third season of \"Botched\" every Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on E!\u00a0", "title": "Yes, Every Female Celebrity Has Done This Surgery"}
