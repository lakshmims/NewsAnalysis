It has a tradition that is centuries old, so we get it. But not everyone is understanding. Some people want to break out of the norms that keep things rooted in tradition, and those are the folks who have created Gik, the world's first blue wine.\u00a0Yep, blue wine,\u00a0like Cura\u00e7ao-blue. The 11.5 percent ABV wine is given this beautiful indigo hue by mixing red and white grapes, as well as two organic pigments -- indigo and anthocyanin -- which are found in the skin of grapes. The wine is made from a blend of Spanish grapes from no particular region, again breaking from tradition.\nThe six 20-somethings behind the production of this wine are not vintners,\u00a0nor are they wine connoisseurs. They're simply innovators looking to shake things up. The co-founders believe that \u201cdrinking G\u00efk is not just about drinking blue wine; you are drinking innovation. You are drinking creation. You are breaking the rules and creating your own ones. You are reinventing traditions.\"\u00a0\nGik is available for purchase online. If it will reign over ros\u00e9 (a.k.a. summer's water), we're not sure what this says for our futures.\nH/T Fine Dining Lovers", "title": "Move Over Ros\u00e9, Blue Wine Is Now On The Market"}
