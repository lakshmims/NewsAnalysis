Simpson murder trial dominated the news and our cultural consciousness. The obsession for all things O.J. has returned in recent months, thanks to FX\u2019s \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d and ESPN\u2019s epic five-part documentary \"O.J.: Made in America.\"\u00a0There\u2019s so much to say about Simpson that it\u2019s only in Part 4 of the 464-minute doc that we finally get to the trial of the century.\nThe trial became an all out media circus that captivated the country from the moment the former NFL player was arrested on June 17, 1994 to his acquittal on Oct. 3, 1995. And when millions weren\u2019t tuning in to CNN or Court TV for up-to-the-minute coverage of the trial, there\u2019s a good chance audiences were laughing at its many preposterous moments on late night. Despite the fact that this case was about two brutal murders,\u00a0the crazy court proceedings made the trial an easy target for jokes.\u00a0\n\u201cMade in America\u201d features a short clip from the\u00a0cold open sketch that kicked off Season 21 of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d on Sept. 30, 1995 \u00a0-- that\u2019s just three days before the jury handed down their verdict. The sketch -- an extreme parody of Simpson's lawyer Johnnie Cochran's obvious efforts to downplay evidence and manipulate the predominantly black jury through the use of\u00a0brightly-patterned \u201cAfro-centric\u201d ties\u00a0-- is likely how many remember O.J.\u00a0coverage on \"SNL.\"But \u201cSNL\u201d wasn\u2019t just a funhouse mirror that amplified the already absurdist minutiae of the case -- the show had its own strange effect on the trial, as well. In fact, a potential juror was dismissed during the jury selection process after she complained of \u201cundue attention,\u201d blaming the NBC show for a sketch that doesn\u2019t actually appear to have existed.\nThis juror -- Juror No. 32 -- was the very first prospective juror questioned on Sept. 26, 1994. As fate would have it, 32 was also the number Simpson wore during his turn in the NFL. According to The Los Angeles Times, this coincidence did not go unnoticed by Judge Lance Ito, who remarked, \"I don't know if this is an omen.\u201d\nWhen Juror No. 32 -- a 31-year-old divorced white woman from Pasadena -- was dismissed, it was because she complained to Ito that \u201cthere is undue attention being drawn to me because of my juror number.\"\nAccording to The New York Times, the woman also cited a recent skit on \u201cSNL\u201d in which she said an actor portraying Juror No. 32 winked at Judge Ito.\u00a0Strangely, when The Los Angeles Times reported the same story, they wrote that she complained of a skit in which an \u201cIto character winks at Juror No. 32.\u201d \u00a0\nThe Huffington Post attempted to track down the \u201cSNL\u201d sketch that allowed this juror to be dismissed from duty. After exhaustive research, we\u2019ve concluded that it simply doesn\u2019t exist and never did. \u00a0All of the sketches involving the Simpson trial that aired in the time period between when Juror No. 32 was called for questioning and when she was dismissed are currently streamable online, and even the juror described doesn\u2019t appear in any of them. \nNBC did not respond to a request for comment, but former \"SNL\" writer Bob Odenkirk (yes, of \"Breaking Bad\" fame) kindly assisted HuffPost in our search. He connected us with Robert Smigel -- a former longtime \"SNL\" writer and the\u00a0man behind Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog -- who confirmed HuffPost's suspicions. Smigel said via email that\u00a0he had \u201cno memory\u201d of the sketch described by the juror. \u201cI know I wrote, like, three O.J. sketches that year, but none were that,\u201d he said.And you should have faith in Smigel\u2019s account since there are, in fact, only three O.J. sketches that aired during the\u00a0pre-trial period\u00a0in 1994 -- and only one of them aired between Sept. 26 and Oct. 17. (There was also a\u00a0\u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment, which featured\u00a0Mike Myers as Judge Ito, but it aired well after the juror had been dismissed).\nEven if Juror No. 32 never complained, it\u2019s unlikely that an educated, divorced white woman would have survived the voir dire process to fulfill her civic duty and serve on the jury. The fact that a potential juror could fabricate an entire \u201cSNL\" sketch to get out of jury duty in the most high-profile murder case at the time -- and that no one checked that it actually existed -- is a testament to the s**t show that was unfolding. It\u2019s the same carelessness that almost forced Judge Ito to recuse himself nearly eight months into the trial, when it was revealed that Ito\u2019s wife, Capt. Margaret York, had been detective Mark Fuhrman's superior officer in the past.\u00a0\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af", "title": "A Woman Managed To Shirk Jury Duty On The O.J.
