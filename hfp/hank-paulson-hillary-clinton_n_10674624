Bush, wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.\n\"I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world,\" he said.\nPaulson accused Trump, who has touted his business acumen as a real estate developer during his campaign, of taking \"imprudent risk\" and then disavowing his debts when ventures fail.\nHe also took aim at Trump's opposition to trade agreements, which Paulson said have created U.S. jobs and fostered innovation and competitiveness.\n\"Simply put, a Trump presidency is unthinkable,\" Paulson said.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBrent Scowcroft, a national security adviser to two Republican presidents, endorsed Clinton on Wednesday, and Richard Armitage, a deputy secretary of state under George W. Bush, said last week he would support her.\nPaulson, who helped steer a $700 billion bailout of the financial system through Congress during the financial meltdown, said Trump is a \"phony\" who is unfit to be president.\n\"I can't help but think what would have happened if a divisive character such as Trump were president during the 2008 financial crisis, at a time when leadership, compromise and careful analysis were critical,\" he said.", "title": "Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson Says He Will Vote For Hillary Clinton"}
