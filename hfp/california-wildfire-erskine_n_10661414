California Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Kern County.\n\"This has been a massive amount of evacuations, people going door to door asking people to leave their homes because it's very dangerous out there,\" Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told reporters at a Friday evening press conference.Youngblood said two people had been confirmed killed in the inferno and that more fatalities could be discovered once authorities were able to search burned out neighborhoods.\n\"We're gonna go back over the rubble with cadaver dogs,\" he said. \"We don't know if there are other victims who were unable to escape this fire.\"\nFire officials said they had zero containment of the Erskine Fire, which was being driven by high temperatures and bone-dry vegetation from a five-year California drought.\n\"Everything is just working into a perfect storm,\" Kern County fire Captain Mike Nicholas said in a phone interview.\nSome 800 firefighters struggled against the fast-moving flames in steep terrain.On Friday, authorities warned the more than 3,000 residents of the community of Lake Isabella on the shore of a reservoir to be prepared to evacuate.\nSoutheast of Lake Isabella, dozens of burned-out homes and car frames could be seen in a neighborhood reduced to a field of mangled metal and collapsed roofs. Two groups of residents picked through the rubble while firefighters worked in the area.\nThe rapidly expanding blaze 150 miles (241 km) north of Los Angeles has destroyed 100 structures, including homes, outbuildings and detached garages, Nicholas said. Another 1,500 structures were threatened.\nMorgan Rivers, an evacuee from the blaze, told Los Angeles television station KABC she lost the house that belonged to her late grandmother.\n\"It's fully mine now and I just lost it after getting it last year,\" Rivers told the station.To the south, firefighters were struggling to manage the so-called San Gabriel Complex fire in the foothills of Los Angeles County.\nAs of Friday, it had burned over 5,300 acres (2,144 hectares) of chaparral and short grass, and containment lines were drawn around 30 percent of its perimeter. All evacuation orders have been lifted.\n(Reporting by Noah Berger in Kern County, Curtis Skinner in San Francisco, Laila Kearney in New York, Eric M.
