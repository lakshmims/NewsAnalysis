While he told media outlets earlier that his son, Omar Mateen, was enraged by seeing two men kissing recently and was not motivated by religion, he said in the video that he did not know what pushed his son into committing mass murder.\nSeddique Mateen, aka Mir Mateen, has also raised eyebrows for previous videos. The Guardian reported that in one recent Facebook video,\u00a0he appears to act the part of Afghanistan's president, telling the \u201crevolutionaries of Afghanistan\u201d to overthrow their current government. On a Facebook page titled \"Provisional Government of Afghanistan,\" he wears military fatigues and, speaking in Dari, orders the arrest of several political figures, including Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.According to Reuters, the elder Mateen previously bought air time to\u00a0host a satellite television show\u00a0he recorded in Canoga Park, California. The wire service characterized him as \"a fringe political commentator who rails against Pakistan and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, expressing largely anti-Pakistan views.\"\nIn one YouTube video on his channel,\u00a0Mateen praises the Afghan Taliban while denouncing the Pakistani government over an ethnic border issue, the Post pointed out.", "title": "Shooter's Father Says 'God Himself Will Punish ...
