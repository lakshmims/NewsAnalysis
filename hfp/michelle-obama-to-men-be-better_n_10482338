Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama hanging out and discussing gender equality. \u00a0\nAt Tuesday's United State of Women Summit, Winfrey and Obama talked about knowing your worth and how to handle your haters.\u00a0The two also discussed the importance of men's roles in gender equality, with Winfrey referencing President Barack Obama's powerful speech at the summit where he told the crowd \"I may be a little grayer than I was eight years ago, but this is what a feminist looks like.\"\nFLOTUS said men should simply \"be better\" if they want to help women achieve gender equality.\u00a0\"Be better at everything,\" she continued. \"Be better fathers.\u00a0 Good lord, just being good fathers who love your daughters and are providing a solid example of what it means to be a good man in the world, showing them what it feels like to be loved. That is the greatest gift that the men in my life gave to me.\"\nShe told Winfrey that it's sad that her experience of never being physically abused by a man is a \"rare reality.\" Stopping violence against women is something men \"can be better at,\" she added.\u00a0\nWhether you're a father, an employer, a partner or all of the above -- FLOTUS said that \"being better\" applies to\u00a0all men:\u00a0\n\nMen can be better husbands, which is -- be a part of your family\u2019s life. Do the dishes. Don\u2019t babysit your children. You don\u2019t babysit your own children. Be engaged. Don\u2019t just think going to work and coming home makes you a man. Being a father, being engaged, all that stuff is important.\u00a0Be a better employer. When you are sitting at a seat of power at a table of any kind and you look around you just see you, it\u2019s just you and a bunch of men around a table, on a golf course, making deals, and you allow that to happen, and you\u2019re OK with that -- be better.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"hateration,\" as Winfrey called it, Obama said she just ignores it and proves them wrong.\u00a0\n\"People won\u2019t remember what other people say about you, but they will remember what you do,\" Obama told Winfrey. \"So my strategy -- and I\u2019ve always been like this. When a teacher would come and tell me that I couldn\u2019t do something, I would get so much satisfaction proving them wrong. I\u2019d be like, OK, all right, oh, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do X, Y and Z, well, I\u2019m going to be the best X, Y, Z you can imagine.\"She said she lets her hard work speak for itself:\u00a0\n\nLet me wake up every day and work hard to do something of value, and to do it well, and to do something consequential, and to do something that I care about.\u00a0And then let that speak for itself. And that would shut up the haters, because I would have a whole portfolio of stuff that defined me because it\u2019s what I did, not what you called me. So the best revenge is success... and good work. You don\u2019t have to say anything to the haters.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have to acknowledge them at all. You just wake up every morning and be the best you you can be. And that tends to shut them up.\n\nThe First Lady added that our fight for gender equality will never be fully finished.\u00a0\"So the work continues,\" she said. \"And for all the young women in this room, all the young men, we can never be complacent. Because we have seen in recent times how quickly things can be taken away if we aren\u2019t vigilant, if we don\u2019t know our history, if we don\u2019t continue the work.\"\nTowards the end of the discussion, Winfrey thanked Obama for her service and how she's carried herself throughout the eight years her and the president have been in office.\u00a0\n\"The way you\u2019ve handled this office, the way you carry yourself, have presented yourself to the United States of America, and the women of the United States of America, and men of the United States of America, reminds me of a line that Maya used to say -- it\u2019s actually in the beginning of one of her books -- she says 'You make me proud to spell my name W-O-M-A-N.' Michelle Obama.\"\nAmen to that.\u00a0\nWatch the full conversation below.\u00a0", "title": "Michelle Obama To Men: 'Be Better'"}
