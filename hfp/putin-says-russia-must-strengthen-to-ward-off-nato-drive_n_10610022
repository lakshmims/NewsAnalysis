In these conditions, we are duty-bound to pay special attention to solving the task of strengthening the combat readiness of our country.\"\n\n\nThe U.S.-led military alliance is increasing its defenses in Poland and the three Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as part of a wider deterrent that it hopes will discourage Russia from any repetition of its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014.\n\nRussia sees NATO's deterrence plans as hostile.\n\nDrawing historic parallels with the 1930s, Putin said humanity now faced a danger of failing to withstand the fast-spreading threat of terrorism, just as it once failed to unite against the rising power of Nazi Germany.\n\n\"The world community did not show enough vigilance, will and consolidation to prevent that war and save millions of lives,\" Putin said.\n\n\"What kind of a lesson is still needed today to discard old and frayed ideological disagreements and geopolitical games and to unite in the fight against international terrorism?\"\n\n\u00a0\n\n(Reporting by Denis Pinchuk; Writing by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by Maria Kiselyova and Richard Balmforth)\n\n", "title": "Putin Says Russia Must Strengthen To Ward Off NATO Drive"}
