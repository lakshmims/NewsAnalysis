If you don't score you pay for it.\"\nThe result lifted Peru to the top of Group B and eliminated Brazil, who dropped down to third place behind Ecuador in the tournament being played in the United States to celebrate the centenary of governing body CONMEBOL and the Copa America.\u00a0\nFollowing the conclusion of the first two groups in the 16-team competition, Peru will play Colombia in the quarter-finals in New Jersey on Friday, while the host nation will take on Ecuador in Seattle a day earlier.\nMexico, Venezuela and Argentina have already qualified from the other two groups with a match to play with either Chile or Panama joining them in the quarter-finals pending the result of their showdown on Tuesday.\nMISSED OPPORTUNITY\nThe loss was a harsh one for Brazil, who knew a draw would have been enough to see them advance and were generally the better team without ever really threatening the Peruvian goal.\nPeru upped the tempo after a lackluster first half and the controversial decider came after 74 minutes when Andy Polo whipped in a low cross that fell just behind the onrushing Ruidiaz inside the six-yard box.\nThe Universitario player appeared to handle the ball into the net to the immediate anger of the Brazilian players, who surrounded the Uruguayan referee along with several Peruvians before the official opted to give the goal after a long delay.\nElias then missed a golden opportunity to equalize for Brazil in injury time but he failed to connect properly with only the goalkeeper to beat.\u00a0\nThe result came just hours after Ecuador hammered a hapless Haiti 4-0 to guarantee their quarter-final berth.\nEnner Valencia opened the scoring after 10 minutes and Jaime Ayovi doubled Ecuador's advantage nine minutes later after a swift counter-attack.\nChristian Noboa made it 3-0 with a well-placed shot after 56 minutes before Antonio Valencia tapped home the fourth after another break on 77 minutes.\nThe result left Haiti, who were competing in the competition for the first time, bottom of the group on no points and a goal difference of minus 11.", "title": "Contentious Peru Goal Knocks Brazil Out Of The Copa America Centenario"}
