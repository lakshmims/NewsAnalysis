Pride\u2019s annual parade on a float with the stars of \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny In Philadelphia.\u201d Noting that he \u201chad the best time being out, proud and not being afraid at all,\u201d Bass lined up appearances at Pride events in New York, Denver and, of course, Orlando shortly thereafter.\n\u201cSo much of the community is scared. They\u2019re frightened,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to show people that you shouldn\u2019t be scared. Nothing\u2019s going to stop me from being who I am, and waving the flag very proudly.\u201dThe tragedy also strengthened Bass\u2019s passion for the American Express\u00a0Pride effort, which encourages users to share how they \"express love\" on social media and offers support for local advocacy groups, such as the Stonewall Community Foundation\u00a0in New York.\u00a0\nSix years after he came out in a highly-publicized People magazine interview, Bass has no time for haters who might take issue with how he and his husband, Michael Turchin, show affection.\n\u201cEven now, I find myself sometimes wondering if I should grab my husband's hand in public in certain places, and I should never have to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my problem. It\u2019s their problem, if they\u2019re against it.\u201dLast year, Bass and Turchin made history when they became the first real-life same-sex couple to tie the knot on an American television network. Their 2014 Los Angeles nuptials were broadcast on the E! special, \u201cLance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding,\u201d in February 2015.\nBass told HuffPost that he and Turchin, who is an artist, are currently at work on a forthcoming men\u2019s accessory line that will comprise of pocket squares, lapel pins and socks in \u201cbright, vibrant colors.\u201d\nGushing over Turchin, Bass said, \u201cHis art is so beautiful. I\u2019m just so excited to be a part of it because I love design, too. So I get to piggyback on his artistry.\u201d\nLeave it to Lance to provide some optimism for the LGBT community, especially when they need it the most. \u00a0\u00a0", "title": "Lance Bass Won't Let Tragedy Stop Him From Expressing Love"}
