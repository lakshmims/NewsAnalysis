The truth is I did vow \u201cI do\u201d at 23.\nMy husband, Steve, and I married young and had a child late.\nWhen I met Steve, I was still grieving over my college sweetheart, who\u2019d left me for medical school and a fear of commitment. Dubiously, I agreed to a blind date. Steve was 26 and still wearing a retainer, a remnant of braces he\u2019d put on to avoid Vietnam.\nI moved in with him six months later.\u00a0My mother refused to visit us and warned, \u201cWhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\u201d\nThen one night, an \u201cold\u201d married friend, tired of watching us smooch, asked, \u201cWhen are you two getting married already?\u201d Back in our living-in-sin apartment, Steve asked, \u201cDo you think we should get married?\u201d He didn\u2019t get down on one knee. \u201cYes, do you?\u201d I asked back.\nProducts of the Great Depression, my parents wanted me to marry \u201cup\u201d the economic ladder. Mom still hid cash under her mattress. At first, she was disappointed in my husband. Her mantra: \u201cIt\u2019s just as easy to fall in love with a rich man as a poor one.\u201d\nInstead, she got a son-in-law who doted on her more than her own son. Steve drove her to doctors\u2019 appointments, changed light bulbs when she could no longer balance herself without a walker, patiently listened to her stories I\u2019d heard too many times before, never bored.\nMom froze the top layer of our wedding cake and served it to us on our first anniversary; I wished she was still around to bore me with her same-old stories on my 40th.\nFor Better or Worse\nAs newlyweds devoted to our careers, Steve and I swam laps after work and grabbed a burrito at 10 p.m. He was a businessman, working long hours. He encouraged me to leave my teaching job and write full-time, in spite of reducing our income.\nHis parents, the only ones in their social circle unable to wear cute baby charms necklaces, pressured us to reproduce. My mother, who already had grandchildren, advised us, \u201cWhy have kids? You\u2019re enjoying your life.\u201d\nOur life was full of ambition, foreign films, lazy Sunday afternoons in bed. We strayed from our friends who had kids, moved to the suburbs and talked about garage door openers. They seemed envious of our carefree existence, and we were afraid of becoming them.\nI stood by my husband during a year of unemployment and what-do-I-want-to-do-with-the-rest-of-my-life? I had back surgery (successful) and he had his first colonoscopy (polyps gone!). I took dance classes and he studied karate. We sojourned to romantic inns in New England. We went to our grandparents\u2019 funerals. I had a miscarriage.\nI was 39. We were ready to settle down. We were terrified of settling down.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want our relationship to change,\u201d I told him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the most important person in the world to me,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing will change.\u201d\n\u201cAnd no garage door openers.\u201d\n\u201cWe live in a twenty-one story high-rise,\u201d he said, laughing.\nI delivered our daughter, Amy, at the age of 41. We were na\u00efve to think our relationship wouldn\u2019t change. Google \u201cruin a marriage by having children,\u201d and 79.9 million results pop up.\nOur romance shifted to the cute baby, the toddler who exhausted us, the preschooler in blatant Oedipal phase, showering Steve with neon-colored hearts: I LOVE YOU DADDY!!!!!\nWe evolved into soccer parents and chefs de cuisine, nursemaids cleaning up vomit, neurotic parents surviving an overnight hospitalization when our 3-year-old became dehydrated. All the while managing my mother\u2019s care as she disappeared into Lewy body dementia. Watching a parent die adds no romance to a marriage.\nNo wonder we were spent the first time we dropped Amy off at college. We drove home dazed. Wandered around the streets like jet-lagged tourists, looking for a quick dinner. Neither one of us could speak. Finally: \u201cWant another slice, or are you done?\u201d my husband asked. \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I replied. Everyone around us looked under 30. Why were they eating dinner so late? We\u2019d become accustomed to six o\u2019clock meals to feed a cranky child. We liked our new habit \u2014 in spite of having made fun of our parents for insisting on all those early-bird specials.\nThe City of Love\nA few months earlier, we\u2019d taken Amy to Paris as a graduation trip. The city of love we\u2019d explored three decades ago. Strolling by the Seine at sunset, we passed couples dangling their feet over the river\u2019s edge. We had an argument that brought me to tears, one of those marital tiffs where, later, neither one of us could remember why it had started.\nAmy wondered if we\u2019d ever been in love like these couples on the Seine? Yes we had, and still were. It\u2019s impossible to explain the evolution of a long marriage to an 18-year-old. I vowed to never turn into the marriage of my parents. I remember the shock when my mother told me, \u201cDaddy and I still make love.\u201d She was in her seventies.\nAfter my father died, a man romanced her as if he were 20, rather than 82. I saw my mother smitten, the way she must have been with my father when he first courted her. By the time children grow up, we view our parents in a different phase of their marriage and can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d once been youthful lovers.\nSteve and I have seen each other naked in lust, and we\u2019ve bathed each other when surgery scars were raw. We\u2019ve watched a baby come into the world, created from love. We\u2019ve morphed from lovers to parents to empty nesters, filling up the empty space with books, hobbies, naps. Discovering conversations to share about politics. Sharing dreams of retirement. Together, but not knowing what this next phase will be like.\nTill Death Do Us Part\nOur grandparents\u2019 unions ended in widowhood, marriages shortened by tuberculosis and heart attacks. Our parents\u2019 generation stayed married because they were supposed to. My own parents\u2019 marriage almost made it to 50 years, until my father\u2019s death cut it short.\nOur divorced friends have been traumatized, regretful, but never ostracized. When my daughter was in preschool, her teacher glanced around during a parent visiting day and whispered, \u201cBy kindergarten, half will be divorced.\u201d\nThis is the 40th time my husband and I have exchanged anniversary cards. We\u2019re not big on gifts, but cards are an unwritten agreement in our marriage contract. I try to think of something profound to write. Our marriage has been ordinary and extraordinary. What is new to express? Maybe \u201cwe\u2019re still married\u201d is enough. Not out of duty, sentimentality or societal norm. Out of love, a lot of perseverance, a bit of luck and the courage to open a slammed door after an argument and say \u201csorry.\u201d\nPerhaps I should use someone else\u2019s words on my husband\u2019s card. A humorous message? \u201cThe secret of a happy marriage remains a secret,\u201d Henny Youngman. A philosophical one from Nietzshe? \u201cIt is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.\u201d Or something literary, from Simone Signoret: \u201cChains do not hold a marriage together. It is hundreds of tiny threads, which sew people together through the years.\u201d Or a song from Sondheim: \u201cGood times and bum times, I\u2019ve seen \u2019em all/And, my dear, I\u2019m still here.\u201d\nWhen I met Steve, I never imagined what we\u2019d look like four decades later. The only images that came to mind were from previous generations: cranky women in housedresses, distant men in golf shirts, wives making roast beef dinners for husbands who\u2019d arrive home loosening their ties after a tiring commute. Saturday-night bridge games, blaming each other for making the wrong bid.\nSplurging on an elegant French dinner, I see an older version of the man who talked to me for hours before we first saw each other\u2019s faces, conversing as if we\u2019d always known each other. Now we run out of things to say. His habits can be annoying. Sometimes he\u2019s inflexible. So am I. He\u2019s also kind, empathetic, always there in a crisis. I hope I am, too.\nWe play a game in restaurants, predicting what each other will order. Our accuracy rate is 95 percent.\nWith This Ring\nOur fingers have sagged and spread, even though neither of us is overweight. It\u2019s been years since we wore the gold bands we exchanged long ago, announcing our status.\nOn the eve of this anniversary, I enlist a friend in the jewelry business to see if I can get my ring resized. He measures my finger, examines the inside of the ring.\n\u201cI have to warn you,\u201d he says, \u201cthe inscription might get ruined if the ring is stretched.\u201d\nI love you, U-Bet, Steve had inscribed. I taught him how to make egg creams when everything about each other was still so new. The key to the recipe is U-Bet, the champagne of chocolate syrups manufactured where I grew up, Brooklyn\u2019s nectar of the gods.\nMy jeweler friend returns with bad news. My ring has a hairline crack and might break if stretched. It is beyond repair.\n\u201cShe can wear it on a chain around her neck,\u201d Steve suggests.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we did in high school,\u201d the jeweler says, laughing.\nI once removed it before knee surgery. I used soap to force the ring to part with my fourth finger. Now I return the ring to my dresser, nestling it on a velvet cushion. I feel sad, but the mood lifts when I realize and hope this will be the worst news I ever receive about our 40 years together. We have outgrown our wedding rings, but not our marriage.\nRead more from Next Avenue:\nHow to find a great place to live or make yours one\nThe big problem new retirees run into\nWhy couples divorce after decades of marriage\n\u00a0", "title": "This Is REALLY How A Marriage Changes Over 40 Years"}
