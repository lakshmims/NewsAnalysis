Smith's finest moment came during the 2016 NBA Finals, when he helped his Cavaliers overcome a 3-1 deficit to win Cleveland its first championship since 1964. That is incorrect. Smith's actual finest moment came via an exchange that went down in the DMs on January 26, 2013.Everything about the above exchange is perfect. The language. The pace. The period of time between messages. And then, of course, there are the final five words: \"You trying to get the pipe?\" If you don't know what that means, we're not going to explain it, but suffice it to say\u00a0the phrase has become the stuff of legend.\u00a0\nAnyway, we'll keep this brief because it's almost the weekend: Some guy asked J.R. Smith to sign a pipe, and he did so because J.R. Smith is the man.\u00a0Let's look at that baby just a little bit closer:\u00a0And now the faces:Nice.", "title": "You Trying To Sign The Pipe?"}
