The Cronut, for instance, is an all-star. Ramen pot pie on the other hand, the world could have done without.\nBut today, friends, we found a winner.\u00a0Behold, the sushi donut (or doughnut, depending who you are).Don't worry, we're not talking about a deep fried, chocolate-covered California roll. A sushi donut is simply the components of sushi formed into the shape of a donut.\nFood blogger Sam Murphy, aka So Beautifully Raw, created the vegan sushi donuts above by shaping cooled sushi rice with a donut mold and decorating the rings with black sesame seeds, ginger, wasabi, cashew mayo and avocado.\u00a0Though Murphy's donuts are vegan, we're already dreaming up creations that incorporate fish, shrimp, roe and tempura.\nMurphy told The Huffington Post that her idea stemmed from some National Donut Day experimentation and an obsession with sushi (we can totally relate).\nNow sushi donuts are popping up all over Instagram -- even Whole Foods is getting in on the action -- and we're drooling all over our desks.
