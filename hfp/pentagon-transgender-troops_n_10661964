But the plan would also direct each branch of the armed services to implement new policies affecting everything from recruiting to housing for transgender troops, the official said.\nSupporters of transgender rights cheered the news. Ashley Broadway-Mack, president of the American Military Partner Association, said in a statement: \"Our transgender service members and their families are breathing a huge sigh of relief.\"\nThe National Center for Transgender Equality estimated last year that 15,000 trans people served in the U.S. military.\n(Reporting by Eric Beech, Mohammad Zargham, Phil Stewart, Idrees Ali)", "title": "Pentagon To Repeal Ban On Transgender Troops"}
