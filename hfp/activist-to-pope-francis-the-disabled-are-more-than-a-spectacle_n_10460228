The disabled need more, in terms of both access to the Church and inclusion in it.\nLast Sunday, Pope Francis led a mass in St. Peter\u2019s Square focused on people with disabilities and the need to build a more inclusive society.\u00a0 The event featured stories from people with disabilities and caregivers, participation by altar boys with Down syndrome, a reading from a blind young woman, and the event was streamed with sign language translation.", "title": "Activist To Pope Francis: The Disabled Are More Than A Spectacle"}
