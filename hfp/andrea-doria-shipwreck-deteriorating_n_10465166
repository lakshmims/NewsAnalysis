Crew members soon found that the Andrea Doria's bow had nearly broken off.\u00a0\"It looks so dramatically different,\" said OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, according to the AP. \"When you look at the shape of the hull, it appears a lot has come off.\"\n\nThe wreck is collapsing due to changes in the marine environment and fishing activity. As the Andrea Doria continues to decay, it's becoming more dangerous for scuba divers, says National Geographic.\nCurrently, the wreck lies at roughly 70 feet below the suggested maximum depth for recreational diver. That, combined with strong currents, sharks\u00a0and low visibility, makes it very difficult for divers who once relied on easily identifiable landmarks to figure out where they are.\nSixteen divers have died in the wreck over the years, which is why it's now dubbed the \"Mount Everest of shipwrecks.\"\nOceanGate's team spent two full days at the wreck and obtained new sonar images of it. Crew members had originally planned to spend more time down below to capture more detailed images, but bad weather caused the team to cut the trip short. \u00a0\nThe team plans to return next year to continue their sonar imaging and potentially create a 3-D \"virtual model\" of the wreck and debris field to learn more about how shipwrecks decay over time and their impact on marine life.\u00a0\nDivers, you've been warned.", "title": "Sunken Ship Becomes Greater Hazard To Divers Decades After Famous Wreck"}
