In December 2003, he was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent for the purpose of committing a felony. The charges came after\u00a0police raided his Neverland Ranch estate and seized more than 80 video recordings and computer hard drives, as well as notes, diaries, documents, photographs and audiotapes.\nOn Tuesday, RadarOnline released a previously unseen police report from the raid on Jackson\u2019s Santa Barbara estate, detailing the singer\u2019s large collection of pornography and images of nude children.\u00a0\nWhile the report itself had yet to be made public, much of the contents of the documents had been used as evidence for prosecution during Jackson\u2019s 2005 molestation trial. The release of the report 11 years after the trial and seven years after Jackson's death seems to have caused a considerable amount of confusion. With that in mind, here are a few things you should know about the newly surfaced report.\u00a0\nThe police report obtained by RadarOnline is legit. \n The Santa Barbara Sheriff\u2019s Office released a statement on Tuesday explaining, \u201cThe documents with a header titled Sheriff\u2019s Department that contain a case number appear to be Sheriff\u2019s Office documents.\u201d \u00a0\nThe majority of the 88-page report consists of documents with a Sheriff\u2019s Department header and case number, however, the authenticity of the photographs and images included alongside those documents is harder to assess. \u201cThe photos that are interspersed appear to be some evidentiary photos taken by Sheriff\u2019s investigators and others are clearly obtained from the internet,\u201d the Sheriff's Office said.\u00a0\nJackson was not in possession of images that constitute as \u201cchild pornography.\u201d \nPolice state in the report that images found at Neverland Ranch didn\u2019t meet the \u201clegal requirements\u201d to be considered \u201cchild pornography.\u201d Police found nude photos of children, as well as photos of children in various states of undress.The images may not be pornographic, but context is key. The police report repeatedly states that the materials found in Jackson\u2019s home \u201ccan be used as part of a \u2018grooming\u2019 process by which people (those seeking to molest children) are able to lower the inhibitions of their intended victims and facilitate the molestation of said victims.\u201d\nThese images, as well as those from Jackson's pornography collection, were submitted as evidence.\n In January 2005, prosecutors sought to introduce numerous \u201chomosexual and heterosexual picture books, videos and magazines seized on November 13, 2003 from the defendant\u2019s master bedroom suite at Neverland Ranch.\u201d The Santa Barbara District Attorney\u2019s office wrote, \u201cThe listed materials are admissible and relevant as circumstantial evidence on the issues of the defendant's intent, motive and method. They are adjuncts to his plan to seduce young boys, and demonstrate evidence of his preparation for their seductions. They are evidence of his method.\u201d\nDuring the trial, prosecutors presented evidence claiming that\u00a0fingerprints belonging to Jackson, his 13-year-old accuser\u00a0and the accuser\u2019s younger brother were found on porn magazines seized from Jackson\u2019s home. At the time, CNN reported that 12 prints from Jackson were found on eight different magazines,\u00a0five prints from his accuser were found on three magazines, and two prints from the accuser's younger brother were found on a single magazine.\u00a0The fingerprint evidence was important because it supported the accuser's testimony that Jackson had shown him pornography. \nIn later court proceedings, prosecutors actually showed jurors some of the X-rated materials found at Jackson\u2019s estate, such as Hustler and Barely Legal, according to The New York Times. \nThe accusations against Jackson included:\u00a0\u00a0\nJackson\u2019s accuser testified that the singer put his hands down his pants and touched him. The teen testified that while he was staying at Neverland Ranch, he and his brother slept with Jackson in his bed. He also said that Jackson showed him pornography and gave him rum, vodka, whisky and wine to drink. \nThe accuser's testimony was called into question by the defense, who was able to get him to admit that he told a teacher at his school that Jackson did not touch him. He later explained that he only said that Jackson didn\u2019t touch him because he was being bullied. \u201cAll the kids were already making fun of me at the school and I didn't want anyone to think it had really happened,\u201d he said.\nMost of the information in the police report came out during the trial.\nThe police report details Jackson\u2019s large collection of pornography, as well as numerous pictures of nude and semi-clothed children. Some of these images were found in photography books, including Cronos by Pere Formiguera, which again, the police report notes does not meet the legal requirements to be considered child pornography, but can be used to \u201cgroom\u201d potential victims.\nThe book\u00a0Room to Play by Simen Johan, which features sexualized images of children whose faces have been superimposed on adult bodies, was again viewed in this context. Authorities also found numerous photos of children located inside a safe in the employee break room of Jackson\u2019s home.\nAll of this was submitted as evidence in 2005, but prosecutors focused on Jackson\u2019s commercial pornography collection -- not that it helped their case. After the jury acquitted Jackson on all charges in June 2005, jury foreman, Paul Rodriguez, told CNN,\u00a0\"Those are adult magazines. Anybody can own them. It doesn't prove the charge.\"\nThe Michael Jackson Estate released a statement on Tuesday night\u00a0and made the point that the police report seems oddly timed to the anniversary of the singer's death. While that may be true, the contents of the report bring some clarity to one of the trials of the century.\u00a0", "title": "Everything You Need To Know About The Michael Jackson Police Report"}
