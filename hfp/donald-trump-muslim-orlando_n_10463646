Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) took a similar tack.\n\u201cAw, man. I\u2019m not going to speak to that,\u201d she told The Huffington Post when asked about Trump's proposals. \u201cI won\u2019t give you an answer on that today.\u201d\nSen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), meanwhile, refused to even refer to Trump as the party's presumptive nominee, even though the Manhattan businessman has secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination next month at the GOP convention.Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) headed down a flight of stairs and kept walking out of the Capitol as HuffPost tried to get his response to Trump's comments about Muslims.\n\u201cI don\u2019t make any comments on the presidential candidates,\u201d Enzi said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an issue you want to talk to me about that I\u2019m working on, I\u2019m happy to talk about it.\u201d\nAsked if that means he has no thoughts on Trump being his party\u2019s presidential nominee, the Wyoming senator paused, and before walking off, said only, \u201cNot that I\u2019m sharing.\u201d\nThe Republican National Committee, which has fully embraced Trump, issued a statement in response to a searing rebuttal from Obama on Tuesday. His voice steadily rising, the president castigated Republican officials who did not stand up against Trump\u2019s toxic proposals\u00a0and claimed his anti-Muslim bashing would threaten America at home and abroad.\nThe RNC's statement, however, included no reference to Trump or his proposed ban -- almost as if it were issued in an alternate universe in which he did not exist.Jennifer Bendery contributed reporting.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\u00a0", "title": "Some Republicans Can't Even Bear To Acknowledge Donald Trump's Existence"}
