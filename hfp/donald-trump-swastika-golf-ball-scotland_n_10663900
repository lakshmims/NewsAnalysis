On Friday morning, during a\u00a0press conference at one of his Scottish golf courses, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was interrupted by a man wearing a Trump Turnberry sweater, who began handing out red golf balls emblazoned with swastikas.\n\"These are the new balls available from the clubhouse, part of the new Trump Turnberry range, and I forgot to hand them out before,\" the man told the gathered crowd. He was later identified as comedian Lee Nelson\u00a0(real name: Simon Brodkin).\n\"I'm very sorry, Mr. Trump,\" Brodkin said, apologizing for his sub-par\u00a0(and fake) job performance as security attempted to shuffle him away.\nTrump responded with only five words: \"Get him out. Thank you.\"\nAnother protester raised a Mexican flag along the border of Trump's other Scottish course, highlighting the candidate's divisive promise to \"build a wall\" separating the U.S. from its southern neighbor:Brodkin has made high-profile stunts a regular part of his routine.\nLast July, he interrupted a press conference for Sepp Blatter to shower the embattled FIFA president with fake dollar bills. The comedian told Blatter\u00a0-- who was\u00a0later suspended from his job for corruption -- \"Sepp, this is for North Korea in 2026.\"", "title": "Swastika Golf Balls Might Be The Perfect Thing To Hit At A Trump Course"}
