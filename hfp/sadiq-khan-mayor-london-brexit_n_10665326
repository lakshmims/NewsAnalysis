When the country as a whole disagreed with them,\u00a0some even called for the city to\u00a0seek independence from the U.K.\nOthers reached out to reassure EU citizens. One Italian couple living in London found a postcard Friday morning from a neighbor, who wrote that he hoped they would \"stay and be part of the city for many, many years.\"\nYet the future of the three million non-British EU citizens currently living in the U.K. is uncertain. The Vote Leave group was explicit that they should be allowed to stay indefinitely. However, legal experts told the Guardian that there could be new hurdles like re-establishing residency status and that other rights could change.\u00a0\nEuropeans who live in the U.K. expressed concerns about their future. Tadeusz Kaminski, who works as a baker and hails from Warsaw,\u00a0Poland, told the Daily Mail\u00a0that the outcome of the vote shocked her.\n\u201cI think it's a very bad idea,\u201d Kaminski said. \u201cI don't even know if I'll have a future in the UK anymore.\u201d\nKhan ended his statement on Friday by calling for unity. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe all have a responsibility to now seek to heal the divisions that have emerged throughout this campaign -- and to focus on what unites us, rather than that which divides us,\u201d he said.", "title": "London\u2019s Mayor To EU Citizens: 'You Are Very Welcome Here'"}
