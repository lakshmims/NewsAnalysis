Do you want justice?\u201d the lawyer,\u00a0played by H. Jon Benjamin,\u00a0asks. \"Hi, I\u2019m Toby Shrak of the law firm of Shrak and Murphy, but don\u2019t call me, because there\u2019s nothing I can do.\"\nThen victims recount their failed experiences.\nThe clip was originally cut from the Comedy Central series\u2019 \u201cWelcome to the Gun Show\u201d episode, but has been released to the public following the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, which killed 49 people and injured dozens earlier this month.\u00a0\n\"I am sickened by the cowardice of these people who are supposed to lead us,\u201d Schumer told Politico. \"Their dedication seems to be only to dollar signs for their own pockets. In November, we will remember who stood with the gun lobby, rather than their constituents, as we mourned for Orlando.\"\nLast July, a gunman opened fire in a Louisiana theater during a screening of\u00a0Schumer's comedy \"Trainwreck,\" killing two before shooting himself.\n\u201cUnless something is done and done soon, dangerous people will continue to get their hands on guns,\u201d she said at the time, according to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cThe critics scoff and say, \u2018Well, there\u2019s no way to stop crazy people from doing crazy things,\u2019 but they\u2019re wrong. There is a way to stop them. Preventing dangerous people from getting guns is very possible. We have common-sense solutions.\u201d", "title": "Amy Schumer Releases Deleted Gun Sketch"}
