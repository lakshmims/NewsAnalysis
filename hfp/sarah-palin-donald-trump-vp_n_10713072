You know what I mean?\"\nNo, sorry, we actually don't know what you mean.Our best guess is that the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee was saying that Trump should choose someone he trusts so he won't get poisoned, but honestly, who even knows?\nPalin endorsed Trump for president months ago in another address that made very little sense:\n\"Trump\u2019s candidacy\u00a0has exposed, not just that\u00a0tragic \u2014 that ramifications of\u00a0the betrayal of a transformation\u00a0of our country, but, too, he has\u00a0exposed the complicity on both\u00a0sides of the aisle that has\u00a0enabled it, OK?\" she said at the time.\u00a0", "title": "Literally What Is Sarah Palin Even Talking About"}
