In the United States, when one person in a household is obese, that household spends on average an extra 8.0 percent of its annual income on healthcare. In China, having diabetes results in an annual 16.3 percent loss of income for the patient.\u00a0\nDespite the problems, there have been pockets of progress, the report found.\nThe number of stunted children under five is falling in every region except Africa and Oceania, and in Ghana stunting rates have almost halved - to 19 percent from 36 percent - in just over a decade.\n\"Despite the challenges, malnutrition is not inevitable,\" Haddad said, as long as there was political commitment to tackle the issue. \"Where leaders in government, civil society, academia and business are committed... anything is possible,\" he said in a statement with the report.\nAn independent expert group produces the Global Nutrition Report and the International Food Policy Research Institute oversees it. It is funded by various government and philanthropic donors, including the U.S. and British governments, the European Commission and the Gates Foundation.\n(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "title": "Nearly Half Of Deaths Of Children Under 5 Due To Malnutrition: Report"}
