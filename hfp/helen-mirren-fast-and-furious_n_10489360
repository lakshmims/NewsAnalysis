It's all about balance.\u00a0\n\u201cI want to be making film and theater, but film is particularly relevant. I like it to be serious. Of course, having said that, I\u2019m about to do 'Fast and Furious 8,'\u201d the actress told Elle. \u201cBut that\u2019s for the fun of it. So maybe that\u2019s what I want as well, some fun and some relevant, serious, important movies.\u201d\nThe actress added,\u00a0\u201cI love big, fun movies -- as long as they\u2019re well made and they\u2019ve got good scripts. That\u2019s the most important thing.\"\nA big factor in Mirren's decision to join the franchise was her love for driving. But in order to secure her casting, Mirren gave the crew one condition.\u00a0\n\"I said, \u2018I\u2019ll be in it, but only if I\u2019m allowed to drive, if I do drive in it.\u2019 But we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see how it transpires,\u201d the London native said.\u00a0\nYou may think Mirren's casting in the film seems a little random, but back in 2015, she revealed to Yahoo! Movies that being in a \"Fast &\u00a0Furious\" movie was a dream of hers.\u00a0\n\u201cMy great ambition is to be in a 'Fast and Furious' movie. I so want to be a mad driver in a 'Fast and Furious' movie. My claim to fame is I always do my own driving\u00a0--\u00a0I was on 'Top Gear,' and I did [my lap] in a very good time. I keep putting it out there, and they never ask me. I\u2019ll be in 'Fast and Furious 8,'\u201d she teased. \u201cI have to say Vin Diesel is brilliant. I love Vin Diesel. He\u2019s a great guy, smart --\u00a0I love him. It\u2019s partly because of him I\u2019d like to be in one, but also the driving.\u201dMirren also proved she can be a total badass in the film \"Red,\" so we know she'll nail this role.\u00a0\nAside from Mirren, the latest film will feature Clint Eastwood's son, Scott Eastwood, as well as Oscar-winner Charlize Theron. Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez will also be back to reprise their roles.\u00a0\nIt's going to be one hell of a star-studded ride.", "title": "Dame Helen Mirren To Grace 'Fast & Furious' Franchise With Her Presence"}
