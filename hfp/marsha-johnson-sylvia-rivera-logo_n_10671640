This year the queer entertainment network chose to honor Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two trans women of color who were at the forefront of the fight of liberation during their lifetimes -- and whose legacies continue to live on today.\nWhile the narrative of Stonewall bar as the birth of the modern day queer rights movement is often whitewashed, Johnson and Rivera were present the night of the rebellion and are largely credited with being some of the first to fight back against police.\nThey went on to be leaders in the movement for queer rights, being highly visible at a time that was both critical for the movement and dangerous for their own personal safety. They both marched in the first Queer Pride march in 1970 and continued to do so until Johnson's tragic death in 1992.\nDuring the \"Trailblazer Honors,\" trans icons Tiq Milan, Candis Cayne and Janet Mock introduced the incredible above film reel of Johnson and Rivera's lives and legacies, and presented them posthumously with the honor of a Trailblazer award.\nCheck out the clip above and tune into the \"Trailblazer Honors\" tonight, June 25, on Logo and VH1 at 8pm ET/PT.", "title": "Marsha P. Johnson And Sylvia Rivera Honored By Modern Day Trans Heroes"}
