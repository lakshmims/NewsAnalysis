She said that he beat her over things like unfinished laundry, confiscated her paychecks and banned her from speaking to her family -- acts that left her feeling isolated, vulnerable and afraid.\u00a0\n\"He would often get into fights and arguments with his parents but because I was the only one in his life most of the violence was towards me at that time,\" she told reporters from her home in Colorado, where she eventually moved after divorcing Mateen in 2009.\u00a0\n\"My family literally rescued me,\" she said. \"They had to pull me out of his arms and buy an emergency flight. I left all my belongings.\"\nSeven years later, Mateen's violence would be directed outward,\u00a0toward Orlando's vibrant gay community. On early Sunday morning, he stormed the nightclub Pulse, slaughtering 49 people and injuring another 53 before police killed him after an hourslong standoff.\u00a0While Yusifiy says she never saw Mateen support terrorism, public discussion has focused on his potential terrorist connections after reports that he called 911 and pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State.\u00a0Did he actually have ties to ISIS? Did he harbor anti-American sentiments? Did he in fact cheer when he heard about the Sept. 11 attacks? We don't know all the answers yet, but by singlehandedly focusing on this line of questioning, we risk overlooking more critical indicators.\u00a0\nTo understand if authorities missed clues that Mateen was capable of carrying out a massacre, we must look to his history of domestic violence\u00a0-- and that of so many before him who have committed mass killings.\nTime after time, men (and yes, it is mostly men) who commit horrific acts of violence against the public have a history of domestic violence against the women closest to them. \nBefore Robert Dear shot to death three strangers in a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs last fall,\u00a0he allegedly beat his wives, targeted other women he came into contact with, was charged with rape and arrested under a \"Peeping Tom\" law.\nBefore Tamerlan Tsarnaev planted bombs at the Boston Marathon with his brother in 2013, killing three people and injuring more than 260 others, he was arrested for beating his girlfriend.\nIn February,\u00a0Cedric Ford stormed through multiple Kansas townships with an assault rifle and a pistol, killing three and injuring 14. Ninety minutes earlier, he'd been served him with a restraining order\u00a0stemming from a domestic violence complaint filed by his ex-girlfriend.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn 2014, when gunman Man Haron Monis seized hostages in a cafe in Sydney, Australia, he was out on bail after being charged as an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife.\u00a0\nAnd so on. The examples are too numerous to list.\u00a0\nAs Shannon Frattaroli, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Vox, \"We know that violence is the best predictor of future violence.\"\nIn fact, according to one analysis of criminal offenders in Washington State, a felony domestic violence conviction may actually be the single greatest predictor of future violent crime among men.\u00a0\n\"Men who commit violence rehearse and perfect it against their families first,\" wrote activists Pamela Shifman and Salamishah Tillet in a New York Times op-ed last year. \"Women and children are target practice, and the home is the training ground for these men\u2019s later actions.\"\nThe\u00a0Huffington Post analyzed\u00a0five years of data on mass shootings (commonly defined one in which at least four people are killed) compiled by the gun violence prevention organization\u00a0Everytown For Gun Safety. We found that in 57 percent of mass shootings, the shooter targeted either a family member or an intimate partner.\nIt's unclear if police were ever notified of Mateen's alleged violence against his ex-wife, and he does not appear to have any convictions for domestic violence,\u00a0which would have prohibited him from owning guns under federal law.\nBut even if Yusifiy did not report his abuse to authorities, as many domestic violence victims do not, she was not the only person who bore witness to his misogynistic tendencies and erratic behavior.\u00a0\nOne of Mateen's co-workers, Daniel Gilroy, told The Los Angeles Times that he \"complained multiple times that [Mateen] was dangerous\" and that he showed anger toward black people, gay people, Jewish people and women.\n\"He did not like black people at all. That was mentioned once or twice, but more so was women,\" Gilroy\u00a0told NBC News. \"He did not like women at all. He did like women in a sexual way, but he did not respect them.\"\nOf course, not all domestic abusers will commit horrific acts of violence against the public. But when men abuse their partners, they are broadcasting that they are violent, dangerous and potentially able to turn that violence against others. It's a warning sign that should be taken seriously.\u00a0\nWe know that domestic violence is quite common in the U.S., where it affects 1\u00a0in 4 women and every single day\u00a0claims three women's lives. Now, it's critical that we begin to recognize it as a key warning sign of a person's potential to commit violence against others. It is a serious issue worth tackling as a public health epidemic\u00a0--\u00a0not just something private that occurs behind closed doors.\n\"Possible ties to terrorist groups seem to be more interesting and frightening to the public than a history of domestic violence, which sadly has become part of the everyday fabric of our society,\" said Kim Gandy, president of the National Network To End Domestic Violence.\n\"Yet by overlooking the fact that many domestic violence perpetrators kill multiple victims \u2013 including but not limited to mass shootings \u2013 we are missing an opportunity to prevent some of this deadly violence, through better enforcement of laws prohibiting domestic abusers\u2019 access to firearms, and by holding abusers accountable for their behavior when it is initially identified.\"\nNeed help?
