You would never do that. You would never just sit there and go, slap me in the face and I\u2019m good with it. No. So why would you open yourself up to that?\"\nLast year, Obama admitted the way she was stereotyped during her during her husband's first presidential campaign got to her.\n\"I had a lot of sleepless nights, worrying about what people thought of me, wondering if I might be hurting my husband\u2019s chances of winning his election, fearing how my girls would feel if they found out what some people were saying about their mom,\u201d she said in a commencement speech at Tuskegee University. She said at the time she moved past the anxiety by focusing on who she really was.\nThe first lady also shared on Tuesday that she strives to overshadow criticism of her with her actions.\n\"The other thing that I have found, particularly in this job, that it\u2019s -- people won\u2019t remember what other people say about you, but they will remember what you do,\" she said. \"So my strategy -- and I\u2019ve always been like this. \u00a0When a teacher would come and tell me that I couldn\u2019t do something, I would get so much satisfaction proving them wrong. \u00a0I\u2019d be like, 'okay, all right, oh, you don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do X, Y and Z, well I\u2019m going to be the best X, Y, Z you can imagine.'\"\n\"So when it came to this role, I just said, you know, let me just be First Lady. \u00a0Let me wake up every day and work hard to do something of value, and to do it well, and to do something consequential, and to do something that I care about,\" she continued. \" And then let that speak for itself. \u00a0And that would shut up the haters, because I would have a whole portfolio of stuff that defined me because it\u2019s what I did, not what you called me. So the best revenge is success.\"", "title": "Michelle Obama Has The Best Advice For Shutting Down The Haters"}
