Which is exactly what happened in the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting.\nThe reasoning behind the FDAs blood ban is, of course, rooted in anxiety surrounding AIDS.\u00a0The agency recently told The Huffington Post, \u201cThe FDA\u2019s mission is to help ensure the safety of the blood supply. Although the current generation of HIV testing that is used to screen the blood supply is highly accurate, it is not perfect.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile prohibiting an entire group of Americans from donating blood was discriminatory and just plain wrong to begin with, to suspect every gay man of having AIDS in 2016 -- and treating them as such -- is ridiculous.\nI'm here to tell the FDA that this current policy not good enough -- and I refuse to sit by during another tragedy affecting the queer community and feel powerless to be proactive in efforts to help those affected. One of the most special things we can do as human beings is show compassion and empathy for one another \u2013 and there are few more authentic ways to do this than giving part of our bodies so we can give others a chance to survive.\nIn recognition of World Blood Donor Day 2016, I'm taking part in a protest of the FDA's discriminatory policy alongside 49 other men. All 50 of us are HIV-negative and on the HIV-preventative drug PrEP, a once-a-day pill that prevents the transmission of the HIV virus. And\u00a0we all donated blood to artist Jordan Eagles' ongoing sculpture \"Blood Mirror.\"Eagle\u2019s \u201cBlood Mirror\u201d is a massive seven-foot-tall monolith, ongoing in its construction, that allows viewers to see themselves reflected in the preserved blood of the MSM who have contributed to its formation.\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are gay, straight, male, female, young, old, or where in the,\u00a0world you were born,\u201d Eagles told The Huffington Post.\u00a0\u201cThis is both an equality and science issue, that affects us all on so many levels. We have the ability to save lives and do what\u2019s right.\u201d\nIn conjunction with \"Blood Mirror,\" some of the blood of these 50 men will be projected on the historic NYC High Line\u2019s 14th street passage tonight as part of a #BloodEquality event called \"Blood Illumination.\"\u00a0Visitors will have the opportunity to have their photo taken against this projection and show their support for #BloodEquality\u00a0when it comes to the donations of MSM.\nIf you are in New York City, come to the High Line between 8:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. tonight in solidarity with not only the men taking part in this protest, but those who have lost their lives because queer people were not able to donate blood in times of crisis.\nTogether, we can change this discriminatory policy -- and ensure that we can always be there for our queer family, in every capacity, no matter what.\n\"Blood Illumination\" will take place along the 14th street passage of the NYC High Line on Tuesday, June 14 from 8:00 p.m. - 10:30 p.m. Head here for more information about the event and here for more about #BloodEquality.", "title": "102 LGBT People Were Maimed Or Killed -- And I Still Can't Donate Blood"}
