It was the first time, and I won't do it again.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" she continued. \"I'm sorry that you can't see my eight years of service in the United States Navy.\u00a0I'm sorry that your narrow misogynistic world view can't conceive of the fact that there are female veterans.\"\nRead the full message below:Above all the other feelings she experienced, Hayes said the note mostly disappointed her.\n\"I felt disappointed that in 2016, my being a female somehow meant I couldn't be a veteran,\" Hayes told The Huffington Post, adding that she has avoided using reserved veteran parking in the past in fear of having to \"explain or justify my being a veteran.\"\nHayes said her husband, who is an Army veteran, uses these types of parking spaces all the time, with no difficulties.\n\"He has never been questioned and if anything, people thank him for his service,\" she told HuffPost.Hayes said that she wrote the\u00a0\"apology\"\u00a0in the hope that the note's author would learn a valuable lesson: There is no such thing as a typical veteran.\n\"Veterans come in all different shapes, sizes, colors, races, genders and religious affiliations,\" Hayes told local NBC affiliate WCNC. \"And you can't necessarily stereotype what an American veteran looks like.\"\nAt the end of her Facebook post, which has been shared more than 3,500 times since Sunday, Hayes offered the note's author one final question.\n\"I served, did you?\"", "title": "Female Veteran Fires Back At Angry Parking Note In The Best Way Possible (UPDATE)"}
