But can you ever just be brow? Welcome to Middlebrow, a weekly examination of pop culture. Sign up to receive it in your inbox weekly.\nIt started as a fling. A friend introduced us, actually.\nSpurned by a few moody fallouts and heartbreaking losses (when I said forever I meant it, \u201cFreaks and Geeks\u201d) I\u2019d been avoiding the TV scene for months. It was time to focus on me. Previous tries at Netflix abstinence hadn\u2019t lasted very long, but for once I was trucking along. I took walks! I kept plants alive! I baked pork loin! I started a yoga regimen led by a peppy YouTube instructor (namaste, Adrienne)!\nSo when a close friend who was staying with me suggested we stay in and watch a show, I was resistant. \u201cLike, a show show?\u201d I probably said. Kindly ignoring my haughtiness, she put on \u201cOutlander.\u201d Predisposed to hating it immediately, I hated it immediately, and fell asleep mid-pilot.I complained later that the dialogue and tagline (\u201cWhat if your future was your past?\u201d) were cheesy. The entire premise -- a woman gets transported from 1945 to 1743, where she meets a handsome Scot and a devilish army officer who happens to look exactly like her erstwhile husband -- was too convenient, and seemed to be a device for allaying wives\u2019 guilt about extramarital fantasies. \nMy adverse reaction wasn\u2019t complicated. While I embrace the idea that so-called genre stories are as valuable as any other kind, both in books and on screen, I grew up loving sci-fi, not chick-lit. As a preteen I read Douglas Adams and Kurt Vonnegut, not Diana Gabaldon, the author of the '90s book series \u201cOutlander\u201d is based on. \nI took pride in my tomboyish tastes, shaped as they were by my mom, who worked full-time and made sure I didn\u2019t play house either. As a kid I was gifted rock tumblers that turned jagged stones into smooth pebbles and planetariums that flecked my bedroom ceiling with constellations. Toys that make you marvel at the blunt yet wondrous facts of the world. These, my family maintained, excluded Barbie dolls.\nWhen I started reading and watching stories, it made sense that I was drawn to those rendered with the rigid lines of realism, even if their subjects were fantastical. Fine details captured my attention more than impressionistic strokes. That a \"Star Trek\" captain had to memorize the vernacular of a physicist was more interesting to me than how that captain related to her crew. \nAt some point -- probably after falling in love, with both characters and realer people -- I started to see beyond my myopic view of storytelling, growing to favor books and shows with heart to those with technical prowess or compelling theories.Choosing to value \u201cevocative\u201d over \u201cimpressive\u201d felt right to me, and in some ways more mature. But, growing up isn\u2019t always linear. I\u2019m still guilty of dismissing a girl-led musical about exes, opting to watch powerful men and women perform political theatre in Washington D.C. or Westeros. Probably influenced by which shows get the most critical acclaim, I\u2019ll watch \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d instead of equally complex and beautifully shot shows about the interiority of romantic relationships. I\u2019ll press pause to rant to my fiance about the lack of emotional nuance, the random nudity that\u2019s touted as subversive. \nBecause of these frustrations, I decided to give \u201cOutlander\u201d another try. It\u2019d gained a cult following, and seemed to be a Lite variety of Romance, one with an acumen for historical detail. This time, I wanted to like it. Like a first date with a Tinder match who wasn\u2019t my type, it was rocky at first, but I reserved judgement, focusing instead on its good qualities: the moody, ethereal shots, the elegant costumes, the subtly communicative body language of actor Caitriona Balfe (who plays the lead, Claire Beauchamp). \nI\u2019ll spare you the Pride and Prejudice reference, but it seemed my first impression was wrong.What first struck me as a pat premise was actually a simple story, one that left room for quieter, less plot-focused beauty. Much of the first season of \u201cOutlander\u201d centers on Claire\u2019s attempt to return to the mysterious stones that cast her back in time, hoping that she can transport herself back to her own present day, and her husband. There are a few violent hangups -- she\u2019s held prisoner by members of the Mackenzie clan who worry she\u2019s a British spy, and is hunted by a violent, self-hating British army man, who questions her motives. But for the most part, the tension is created by just one narrative conflict. \nThe rest of the hour-long episodes are colored in with scenes of Highlander life. A boar hunt, a wedding, a tax-collecting mission, and an oath ceremony are shown in vivid detail. Because Claire views each of these ordinary activities as an opportunity to escape, they\u2019re taut with potential energy, yet they\u2019re pleasingly slow and character-driven. Even the show\u2019s bloodier scenes are atmospheric, heightening the dizzying effects of gore. \nAt first I found these reenactments more pleasing to watch than the more intimate (read: Romance-y) exchanges. It\u2019s easier to give yourself over to a story when the premise is calculated, taking a bird\u2019s eye view of its characters, never getting close enough to reveal their multitudes. The usual hurdles -- forgiving a character her mess of human flaws, dispelling the icky feeling of embarrassment on behalf of someone else\u2019s bald, unironic emotions -- just aren\u2019t there. But as Claire let up on her plans for escape, growing to appreciate the Highlander way of life -- raw, wild, comically zealous -- I did, too. \nIt makes sense that the viewer\u2019s emotional experience would match Claire\u2019s. As an outsider -- a sassenach -- she seeks to understand her surroundings, not participate in the fraught power games herself. What begins as an anthropological examination of a distant culture softens into a story that allows viewers to love each of its characters. \nBecause of this, and because \u201cOutlander\u201d is narrated by Claire rather than presented in third person \u00e0 la \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the sex scenes feel neither gratuitously icky or laugh-inducingly random. When Jamie, Claire\u2019s floppy-haired Scottish lover and husband, tries to whip her as punishment for endangering the clan, I was not left gaping at his cold-heartedness. The brutal scene is couched in so much context -- Jamie\u2019s conception of right and wrong has been shaped by his small social circle, one we\u2019re now well acquainted with -- that it\u2019d be impossible to leave the scene with a clear-cut opinion on his character. Later, Jamie concedes that he and Claire\u2019s specific wants matter more than society's sexspectations (sorry), and they toy around with some new positions.The show directly discusses the murky barrier between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d one so many fantasy stories willingly maintain as solid. Reverend Reginald Wakefield, a friend of Claire\u2019s 20th-century husband, tells him after an altercation, \u201cIt\u2019s fashionable in this modern age to dismiss the idea of good and evil. But there is evil, and it finds purchase in good men, giving sin the sweet taste of ecstasy.\u201d \nViewing morality as fluid rather than inherent is a virtue of even the most formulaic romance novels, the predominant formula being: girl meets \u201cbad boy,\u201d girl wins over \u201cbad boy,\u201d \u201cbad boy\u201d is bad no more. This particular type of moral transformation may be nothing more than a fun fantasy to entertain, but still, it\u2019s more empathy-making than tales of justice-inspired schemes. \nGood versus evil isn\u2019t the only unfair and uninteresting spectrum romance writers can hope to debunk. There are others -- highbrow versus lowbrow, critically acclaimed versus schmaltzy -- overdue for a shakeup. I\u2019m certainly biased, smitten as I am, but I think \u201cOutlander\u201d could be the show to turn the tide. It may be outnumbered, but boy, it has heart.
