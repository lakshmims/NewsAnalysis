The leprechaun was spotted on Thursday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, where the 2016 NBA Draft was taking place. A clear Boston Celtics supporter, he must've been a relative -- a grandson, perhaps -- of Celtics mascot Lucky the Leprechaun.\nHe had good reason to make a rare appearance. The Celtics'\u00a0war chest coming into the night\u00a0contained three first-round picks and five second-round picks. Coupled with a roster full of talented, young and inexpensive starters, Brooklyn's leprechaun probably expected to see a big night of trades by general manager Danny Ainge, and maybe, just maybe, \ufeffto\u00a0witness a superstar head to the Celtics. His luck was going to rub off. It had to.\u00a0\nBut no. Ainge's decisions fell short of expectations. He took a swig of courage and selected UC Berkeley's Jaylen Brown at No. 3\u00a0in a two-player draft, picked two international dudes nobody's heard of with their other two first-round picks, and then ripped off a few trades with the team's second-round picks, ultimately keeping three players from that round.\u00a0Despite rumors of acquiring a star like Jimmy Butler, DeMarcus Cousins or Kevin Love -- the level of player the Celtics need to take the proverbial \"next step\" toward title contention -- nothing materialized for the team.\nThis seriously pissed off our leprechaun, who, after watching nothingness for two and a half hours at the Barclays Center, finally let all of his anger and disappointment out. The Celtics' pick of French player\u00a0Guerschon Yabusele put him over the edge.\u00a0\nWe're sorry to say, but this leprechaun's \"luck\" has evidently run out. He is now an unlucky leprechaun, which doesn't even make him a leprechaun anymore. Just a guy in a goofy green outfit.\nGood luck with that.\u00a0", "title": "Unlucky Leprechaun Appears At The NBA Draft To Screw Over Celtics"}
