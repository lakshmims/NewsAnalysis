We're going to have to change the way we see ourselves and this is happening already, but I want us to be more intentional about it...\u00a0The emotional, sexual and psychological stereotyping of females begin when the doctor says it's a girl\u2026 and that has consequences for all of us -- whether we're men or women, black, white, straight gay, transgender or otherwise.\n\nHe listed \"modern-day heroes\" such as Sonya Sotomayor, Laverne Cox and Michelle Obama who are changing the conversation on gender equality.\n\"The countless ordinary people every day who are bringing us closer to our highest ideas,\" he said. \"That\u2019s the story we\u2019re going to keep on telling, so our girls see that they, too, are America.
