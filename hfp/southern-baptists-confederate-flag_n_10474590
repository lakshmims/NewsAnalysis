The assailant was seen afterward in photographs posing with the flag.\nThe episode stirred a movement to eliminate the Confederate battle flag - seen by many whites as a sign of Southern heritage, not hate - from South Carolina's statehouse and many other public displays in the South during the months that followed.", "title": "U.S. Southern Baptists Formally Repudiate Confederate Flag"}
