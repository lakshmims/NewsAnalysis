Smith argued \ufeffMonday that, if he had been the prosecutor on the O.J. Simpson trial, he would\u2019ve been able to outwit legendary defense attorney Johnnie Cochran and prove to the jury that Simpson did indeed murder ex-wife Nicole Brown Smith and Ronald Goldman.\n\u201cI believe the evidence was clear,\u201d Smith said on his show First Take. \u201c[It] might be the cockiest thing I have ever said \u2026 [but] if it were me, there\u2019s no way in hell Johnnie Cochran would have beaten me with that evidence that they had. I\u2019m telling you right now -- I\u2019m not even a lawyer. There is no way that you would have put 12 jurors in front of me with that evidence and I would have lost.\u201d\nSimpson, whom Smith called \u201cguilty as hell,\u201d was found not guilty on Oct. 3, 1995, in what remains an extremely controversial verdict. The prosecution, led by Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden (whom Smith said did \u201can absolutely horrendous job\u201d), had a glut of evidence that seemed to tip the case in its favor.\nThere was the DNA analysis of blood found in Simpson\u2019s car, on his socks and elsewhere, seemingly damning Simpson. There was material\u00a0detailing prior instances of his domestic abuse. And, most notoriously, there was the single leather glove discovered at the scene of the crime, matching the type that Simpson owned.But after a series of stumbles on the prosecution\u2019s part -- and a master class of a performance from Cochran and the rest of Simpson\u2019s legal team -- Simpson walked. And in the two decades since the case closed, the trial has become a touchstone for both blundering prosecutions and spellbinding defense attorneys.\nLeave it to Stephen A. to claim that he would\u2019ve out-dueled Cochran, thereby changing legal -- and national -- history. Leave it to Stephen A. to see the first part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cO.J.: Made in America\u201d documentary that aired this weekend and imagine himself in that Los Angeles courtroom, going one-on-one against the world-class Cochran, convincing the 12 jurors that even if the glove didn\u2019t fit, they could not acquit.\nLeave it to Stephen A.", "title": "Stephen A.
