She said that while there were initially talks of incorporating a unicorn, the seller she was working with decided a panda would be best.\u00a0And while Arnett hasn't done anything like this before, she said it's always important to put creativity into her work.\u00a0\"I always think it's important to stand out in Real Estate. It's a very competitive business,\" she explained. \"Now that I own my company, Villa Real Estate, I need to be even more competitive. We are a small brand, and need to compete with the larger franchises.\"\n\nThe realtor said it's unlikely she'll do something like this again, however she'll continue to have fun on the job.\nSo far, there haven't been any offers on the house, but Arnett said the effort's all for the client.\u00a0\n\n\n\"My clients know that they are getting the best marketing,\" she said. \"Even million dollar listings don't get this much attention.\"\n", "title": "Realtor Poses As Panda In Listings Because Why Not?"}
