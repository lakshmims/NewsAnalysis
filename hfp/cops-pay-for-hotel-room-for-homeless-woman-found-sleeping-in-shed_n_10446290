So we made it happen,\u201d Dorais said.\nDorais and Witkin brought the woman to a Comfort Inn & Suites,\u00a0where Dorais says he is familiar with the front desk clerk. Dorais explained the situation to the clerk, who agreed to give the woman a room for the night at a discounted price. As Dorais paid for the room on his credit card, Witkin snapped a photo of his partner.The photo was posted to the Meriden Police Department\u2019s Facebook page on Sunday and it\u2019s since received over 3,000 likes, more than 700 shares and hundreds of comments praising the officers\u2019 good deed.\n\"Officer Dorais's act of kindness exemplifies what the men and women of the Meriden Police Department stand for and we are proud of him and all our officers who do these kinds of deeds that are seldom recognized,\" reads the post.\nDorais, who is not a frequent social media user, wasn\u2019t even aware of all the attention the photo was receiving.\n\u201cMy sister called me and was like, \u2018Did you buy a hotel room for a lady?\u2019 And I was like \u2018Yeah.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018it\u2019s all over Facebook.\u2019\u201d\nThe post\u2019s popularity actually surprised Dorais.\n\u201cPolice officers do tons of great things that people don\u2019t know about all the time,\u201d Dorais said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen officers do bigger and better things than what we did. Really it was small in comparison.\u201d", "title": "Cops Pay For Hotel Room For Homeless Woman Found Sleeping In Shed"}
