You can see and you report them to the local police. Most likely you\u2019ll be wrong, but that\u2019s OK. That\u2019s the best way. Everybody\u2019s their own cop in a way.\" \nThose earlier remarks, however, stopped short of proposing that people be punished for not informing on their neighbors --\u00a0a hallmark of some of the most brutal and deadly regimes in history, including Nazi Germany and Russia under Joseph Stalin. \nTrump's latest proposal was part of a speech during which he repeatedly vilified and attacked Muslims, as well as immigrants more generally. \nAs he frequently does, Trump conflated \"radical Islam\" with Islam in general, and warned that \"Radical Islam is coming to our shores.\" \nThe Orlando shooter was a U.S. citizen who was born in the United States in 1986, at a time when the United States and guerrillas in Afghanistan were allies in the fight to contain communism. \u00a0\nNevertheless, Trump said that the correct response to attacks like the one in Orlando is to ban Muslims from visiting or immigrating (Trump regularly confuses these two ideas) to the United States. \nHe also attacked presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who Trump said \"wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country -- they enslave women, and murder gays. I don\u2019t want them in our country.\" \nTrump's claim about the former secretary of state is patently false. Clinton has proposed allowing some Syrian refugees into the United States through the American refugee screening process, which takes an average of two years to approve resettlement.\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that the U.S. and Afghanistan were allies in 1986. The U.S. was allied with guerrillas in Afghanistan.\nEditor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump: Americans Who Don't Report Their Suspicious Neighbors Should Be 'Brought To Justice'"}
