He was administered 14 times the allowed doses of midazolam and a narcotic, hydromorphone, and took almost two hours to die.\nMidazolam, a relative of Valium, has also been cited in a troubled 2014 execution in Oklahoma. It was at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year where the court upheld its use in Oklahoma.\nAfter the high court's ruling, Arizona switched to a three-step protocol of midazolam, a paralytic drug and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.\nThe protocol was the same as that decided in the Supreme Court case, and state lawyers have argued that midazolam thus was acceptable for use in Arizona.\nBut Wake has ruled that Supreme Court decisions in the Oklahoma case and another involving midazolam were based only on the facts specific to them.\nDrug company Pfizer Inc said last month it had banned the sale of execution drugs, including midazolam. The move cut off the last major U.S. source for drugs in the deadly mixes.\nThe number of inmates executed in the United State has plummeted since the 1990s, with 14 executions so far this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
