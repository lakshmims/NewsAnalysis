Garrett, who learned to knit from his grandmother and says it's a calming activity, had wanted to do something for kids with cancer. And though the initial goal was to knit 15 hats, he really \"ran with\" the project and smashed through it with the help of his mother and grandmother.\u00a0Kathleen McBride, director of the Association of Volunteers at Children's Hospital Colorado, said that the gift meant a lot to those at the hospital.\u00a0\n\"This donation in particular was very meaningful as it originated from a donor of a very young age,\" she said. \"It is so powerful for young people to give so generously of themselves for the benefit of their peers.\"\nMcBride added that the love from the hats will be felt far beyond the hospital.\u00a0\n\"They will provide a source of comfort for kids during their hospital stay and long after they have been discharged,\" she said. \u00a0\nLowry told HuffPost that Garrett has always had a big heart. He's been involved in many Ronald McDonald House activities and even used his 7th birthday as a way to collect gifts and donate them to sick kids. She said he wants to continue being involved with the Ronald McDonald House.\u00a0\n\"He's got a very compassionate heart,\" Lowry said. \"He wants to do for others.\"\u00a0", "title": "Big-Hearted 11-Year-Old Knits 50 Hats For Kids With Cancer"}
