My God, of course! But I didn\u2019t want to step on anyone's toes, and ESPN has a cast of hundreds. I didn\u2019t want to take away from what Doris [Burke] or anyone else on the crew did. But yeah, I wanted to be a part of it.\n\nSo why wait until Game 6? According to Sports Illustrated, Sager was scheduled for eight days of chemotherapy following the conclusion of the Western Conference Finals.\u00a0\u201cThat would be the only time I could do a game, and so it had to be Game 6,\" Sager told Sports Illustrated.\u00a0\nSager was diagnosed with leukemia in 2014. For a stretch, his cancer had gone into remission,\u00a0but Sager announced in a interview with HBO's \"Real Sports\" in March that it had returned. Doctors told Sager\u00a0that a patient not receiving treatment for his diagnosis generally would have just three to six months to live.\nHowever,\u00a0Sager went on to tell Sports Illustrated that he did not want to steal the spotlight from the Warriors or the Cavaliers.\n\"I've been watching the series very closely and, while I do not want to distract in any way from the event itself, I look forward to being in the building for what will be an incredibly exciting Game 6,\" Sager said. \"The NBA community is a very special one and this is a great honor.\"\nWith everything set, we now just have to wait and see what wild outfit Sager wears for his first-ever NBA Finals appearance.\u00a0\nIf you need more reasons to be a supporter of Craig Sager,\u00a0here are 8 stories that show how much people love him.", "title": "Craig Sager Is Finally Going To Work His First NBA Finals Game"}
