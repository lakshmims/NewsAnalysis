Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Wednesday left the door open to a last-minute re-election bid after repeatedly saying he would not run again.\nSpeaking to reporters, Rubio confirmed a Politico story detailing the way Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera, a friend of Rubio's who is running for his seat, has encouraged him to run.\n\"Carlos and I had a conversation on Sunday in Orlando before I left. Obviously I take very seriously everything that's going on, not just in Orlando, but in our country. I've enjoyed my service here a lot,\" the Florida senator told reporters. \"So I'll go home later this week, and I'll spend some time with my family and if there's been a change in our status, I'll let everyone know.\nBack in March, Rubio said he would not run for re-election, or for Florida governor in 2018. Even though he insisted he has enjoyed his time in the Senate, he had an abysmal attendance record that he had to defend while running for president.CNN reported last month that Republican leaders had been urging Rubio to reconsider his decision not to run out of fear they could lose the seat to Democrats.\nRubio will have to make a decision by June 24, the state's deadline for filing for office.\nRubio withdrew from the presidential race on March 15, the night he lost Florida's presidential primary to Donald Trump. Toward the end of his campaign, Rubio mocked Trump for having small hands and suggested his Republican rival had a small penis. Rubio later said he regretted making those comments.", "title": "Marco Rubio May Decide He Wants To Run For Re-Election After All"}
