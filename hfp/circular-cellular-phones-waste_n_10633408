Cell phones don't recycle easily.\nThe Huffington Post has highlighted the hazards of electronic waste before: When you throw out an iPhone, it generally goes to a very ugly place to die.\u00a0\nTwo filmmakers, Tom Fox-Davies and Ed Scott-Clarke, friends from school growing up in the southwest of England, teamed up to produce this short film about just how bad the culture of constant electronic upgrades is for the planet.\n\"Circular Cellular\" will focus on Fairphone, a Dutch company that is making modular electronics that break down piece by piece, and are better suited to recycling and reuse.\u00a0By allowing for reuse of material by design, Fairphone fits into the circular economy.\nThe circular economy refers to the idea that with the right design,\u00a0consumer products can be made by repurposing resources already in existence, rather than extracting more from the natural environment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"Both of us are environmentally conscious,\" Fox-Davies told HuffPost in an interview. \"I formerly worked in financial services, on the natural resources side of things. I saw the impact that mining for materials can have on resources across the world.\"\nThe film's takeaway is that consumers can have an impact on the environment through \"purchasing consciously,\" said Fox-Davies. It takes pressure from consumers to make companies more responsible about the resources they use.\n\"If there are already brands out there that are designing in a more responsible manner, then everyone else will follow suit,\" he said.\nThe concept won's Dell's Legacy of Good film contest, so Fox-Davies and Scott-Clarke received a grant from the company to produce the film.\u00a0The full short will debut in August.", "title": "A New Film Explores How To Make Phones Without So Much Waste"}
