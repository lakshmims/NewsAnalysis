After going through Target Zero\u2019s program, it was on pace to save nearly 90 percent of the animals in its public shelter by the end of 2015.\n\u201cWhat they do really works and it works fast,\u201d Duchovny told The Huffington Post.\u00a0\u201cThat's a lot of lives saved.\u201d\u00a0\nThe program has also been successful in Huntsville, Alabama, and other \u201cFellow Cities\u201d (or cities enrolled in the program), including Nashville, Tennessee, El Paso, Texas, Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Indianapolis. The organization is seeking additional funds to do the same work in more cities.Enter Fox Mulder and Brick \u2014 a short, stout, brick-shaped mutt who Duchovny\u2019s assistant found roaming the streets of Los Angeles.\n\u201cHis other name is \u2018Little Bear Fat Fox\u2019 \u2013 but he seems somewhat offended by that,\u201d Duchovny said.\nOffended or not, Brick seems to really dig the peanut butter smeared all over Duchovny\u2019s face \u2014 bestowing him with 46 licks total. After the adorable lick-a-thon, Duchovny challenges his ex-wife, actress T\u00e9a Leoni and his \"X-Files\" co-star, Gillian Anderson, to do the same.\n\u201cThey're both big animal lovers, so I'm pretty sure they'll jump right in,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI hope they get squeamish. You can't not get squeamish when your dog has free rein to lick your entire face.\u201d\nThe goal is to continue challenging others to make similar videos and pledge donations which will hopefully result in a lot of scratch for a great cause \u2014 saving rescue animals, which Duchovny thinks are \u201cthe best.\u201d\n\u201cThey're very loyal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's like they know you got them out of a pickle or something because they're just very attached.\u201d\nAnd if the idea of letting a dog lick your face makes your whimper, Duchovny has a suggestion:\n\u201cI'd say, just go ahead and donate to the cause anyway because it's amazing. But I can attest to the fact that [letting your dog lick your face] is a pretty fun thing to do, once you surrender to the messiness of it.\u201d\u00a0\nIf you would like to join the campaign, make a video of your dog (or cat \u2014 if you can get them to do it) licking your face,\u00a0post it to social media and challenge your friends to do the same. Remember to donate $1 for every lick!\u00a0Or if you\u2019d just like to donate money to the cause without getting saliva all over your face, check out Target Zero\u2019s donation page here.\nCLARIFICATION: This post has been updated to clarify how the campaign works.", "title": "David Duchovny Wants You To Film Your Dog Licking Your Face"}
