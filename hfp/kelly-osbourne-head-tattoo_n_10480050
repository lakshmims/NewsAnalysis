Together, we have strength and powerful harmony,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"I have wanted to get this tattoo for a long time. The tragedy in Orlando devastated me and reminded me that every moment of our lives is precious. Every human is precious.\"\nOsbourne has been a lifelong friend and ally to the LGBTQ community, partnering with organizations like The Trevor Project and Cyndi Lauper's True Colors Fund to highlight the discrimination faced by queer people across the country.\u00a0\n\"Love hard. Live gracefully, authentically and with conviction, respect, purpose and compassion,\" she continued. \"Together we achieve what is impossible to those who stand alone. Those of us who embrace and respect freedom stand together, progress together, celebrate together and grieve together. You are not alone.\"In the wake of the shooting, Osbourne debuted a first draft of the tattoo, while holding a sign sending a message of love to the victims of the attack.\u00a0Her new tattoo pairs well with Osbourne's\u00a0other head tattoo, featuring the word \"stories,\" which she says her mother is not a fan of.\u00a0\n\"All moms want their daughters to be perfect,\" she told ABC News.\u00a0\"Having a tattoo on the side of your head and a mohawk isn\u2019t exactly every mother\u2019s dream and I can understand that.\"\u00a0", "title": "Kelly Osbourne Debuts New Head Tattoo In Solidarity With Orlando Victims"}
