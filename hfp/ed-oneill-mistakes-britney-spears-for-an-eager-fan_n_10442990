I kept saying, 'It's one day, right, guys? I'm doing one day,'\"\u00a0he said. \"So I did the one day, and they called me back, and you know, after, like, months and months, almost a year, I thought, 'This is kind of a big part.'\"\nO'Neill had another hilariously clueless moment recently when he was approached by someone he believed was simply a \"Modern Family\" fan in LAX on his way to Hawaii.\u00a0\n\u201cShe came up and said, \u2018Oh, Mr. O\u2019Neill, I love \"Modern Family\" and you\u2019re my favorite on the show.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m here.
