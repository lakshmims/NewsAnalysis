Police are investigating various \"racially motivated hate crimes\" targeting Poles in England.\nAuthorities first found leaflets saying \"no more Polish vermin\" in central England. Graffiti\u00a0demanding that Poles leave the U.K.\u00a0was later discovered at a Polish cultural center in London.\nThe spokesman for Poland's President Andrzej Duda demanded that Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage, the two primary leaders of the\u00a0\"leave\" movement, condemn the \"outrageous barbarity\" of these actions.\nPrime Minister David Cameron responded to the incidents on Monday. His government\u00a0\u201cwill not tolerate intolerance\u201d and condemns\u00a0\u201csome of the incidents we have seen across the country over the weekend of intimidating migrants and telling them that they need to go home,\" he said.\nAnd a Labour member of parliament,\u00a0Jess Phillips, tweeted that she would submit a question to Parliament to find out how many racial incidents had occurred over the weekend compared with prior to the referendum.\nThis article has been updated to include an incident from Tuesday morning.\u00a0", "title": "Racist Incidents Skyrocket After Brexit Vote"}
