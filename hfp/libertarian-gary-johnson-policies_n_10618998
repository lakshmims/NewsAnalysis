Bill Weld, making this the first time that a Libertarian ticket will grace one of the three major cable news networks for a live presidential forum, according to The Washington Post.\nJohnson, who's had a\u00a0tough time capturing voters' attention in an increasingly personality-driven election season, is a self-described \"fiscally conservative, socially liberal\" candidate.\nConsidering that more than 50 percent of voters\u00a0hold unfavorable views of the two presumptive major party nominees and 47 percent of voters say they're open to a third-party option, Johnson may have an opportunity to make waves this election cycle. He's looking to take at least 15 percent\u00a0in the polls in hopes of securing a spot in the national debates this fall.\u00a0\nAhead of the town hall session, The Huffington Post took a look at Johnson's views on everything from the economy and foreign policy to immigration and social issues. Check it out in the video above.\u00a0\nThis video was produced by Kat Santiago and edited by Zack Chapman.", "title": "Where Libertarian Presidential Candidate Gary Johnson Stands On The Issues"}
