Realizing how imminent the needs of survivors\u2019 and family members are, the group announced on Friday that it would give the entirety of the $7 million raised straight to those affected by the massacre.\nThe money will help survivors pay for such basics as rent and groceries, the New York Times reported.\u00a0\nThe June 12 shooting at a popular gay nightclub in Orlando left 49 people dead and 53 injured.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are working on transitioning the fund in a way that allows it to provide funding directly to victims,\u201d Cassandra Lafser, press secretary, told The Huffington Post. The group will continue to publicize how it's channeling the funds as those decisions are made, Lafser added.\nThe OneOrlando Fund\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of an outcry from fundraising experts and those affected by other mass shootings.A group of 100 people who were impacted by some of the worst shootings in U.S. history issued a statement disparaging the OneOrlando Fund and calling on it to direct the money to victims in need.\nTo underscore the urgency of the issue, the group pointed to other similar funds established in the wake of massacres, which they say failed to address the immediate needs of victims and survivors.\n\u201cThe history of community-based funds in this country is a shameful one,\u201d the letter read. \u201cLet these families of the deceased and the injured heal the way only they know how. Give them the funds that Americans and the world intended for them. They will need it to survive.\u201d\nThe group encouraged donors to give to a GoFundMe campaign set up by Equality Florida, an LGBT rights group, and a fund set up by the National Compassion Fund. Both groups are giving 100 percent of donations to the injured and relatives of the deceased.\nNelba Marquez-Greene, whose 6-year-old daughter was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, signed the letter and wrote a blog for HuffPost admonishing donors to be wary before donating to funds for victims.\u00a0\u201cMillions were poured in to Sandy Hook. Very little actually reached us. And victims of gun violence will have a lifetime of need,\u201d Marquez-Greene wrote. \u201cBefore you give \u2014 ask where your dollars will go. Specify that you want it to go to victim families.\u201d\nAfter the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults, a fund set up with the help of United Way raised $11.4 million in donations. Nearly a year later, an advisory board decided that $7.7 million would be set aside for the victims, Reuters reported.\u00a0\n\u201cYou really have to ask the foundation board why it decided not to distribute all the donated funds to the families,\u201d Kenneth Feinberg,\u00a0who advised the distribution committee and oversaw the victims compensation fund after 9/11, told Reuters.\nThe OneOrlando Fund is also consulting with Feinberg as the city moves forward with the fund, according to the latest press release.\n\u201cWe recognize there are victims in need of support now, and we ask for your patience as we ensure we are able to assist these victims in an open, transparent and equitable manner,\u201d Dyer said in a statement. \u00a0\u201cIn the coming days and weeks we will share more with you on this process and how the community will have a voice.\u201d", "title": "Orlando Fund Giving $7 Million Directly To Victims After Public Outcry"}
