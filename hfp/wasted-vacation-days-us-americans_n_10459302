SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY-EIGHT MILLION vacation days, simply left on the shelf to rot.\u00a0Project: Time Off surveyed more than 5,600 workers with paid time off about their vacation habits.\u00a0They found that\u00a055 percent of U.S.\u00a0employees\u00a0left at least some of their vacation days unused last year.\nAround\u00a0a third of workers took absolutely ZERO vacation days\u00a0in the last year,\u00a0a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll\u00a0confirms.\nInterestingly, changes in vacation habits aren't linked so much to the economy as they are to our ever-increasing dependence on technology, Project: Time Off found. Their research shows that as people become more tied to their phones and email, it becomes harder to pull away from the office.\u00a0But there's a simple way to reverse the problem, says Katie Denis, program director at Project: Time Off.\n\"We\u2019re not going to\u00a0'find'\u00a0time anymore,\" Denis says.\u00a0\"It\u2019s about making time, or being intentional about our time.\"\nHer organization's research found\u00a0planning\u00a0to be the single most important factor in whether people took their vacations or not: Fifty-one percent of those who planned ahead took all of their vacation days last year. They also reported greater happiness\u00a0in their job standing, personal relationships and overall mood.\nDenis suggests workers start by planning to take at least two of their vacation days in the coming year, because research found the average worker loses two vacation days per year that can't be rolled over or paid out.\u00a0\nShe also advises that simply\u00a0staying home for a day -- with your kids, significant other or just yourself -- can be just as memorable as taking a trip.\nWhen you do take a break, you'll find yourself happier, more creative and more productive at work. It may sound counterintuitive, but trust us: A break is worth it.\u00a0We don\u2019t know what you do for a living, but we do know you likely need a break. Therefore, we\u2019re challenging you (yes \u2014 busy, overworked, financially stretched you) to #TakeABreak.\nDuring the month of June, we\u2019ll help you nail down how many vacation days you have, figure out where to go, and plan a trip you can actually afford.\u00a0Sign up for our Take A Break action plan here!", "title": "You Won't Believe How Many Vacation Days America Wasted Last Year"}
