Gov. Gavin Newsom (D). He has portrayed the reforms package as a way to prevent mass shootings -- such as the one that claimed 14 lives in San Bernardino in December -- and curb the influence of the National Rifle Association.\nSome state Senate members hoped Newsom and his supporters would abandon their push for the ballot proposal after lawmakers passed similar legislation in May.\u00a0Lawmakers hope the legislation also passes in the state Assembly rather than leaving it up to voters.\u00a0\nBut Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, has declined to scale back his efforts.Critics in law enforcement and gun rights groups like the NRA contend that criminals will turn to the black market for ammunition while law-abiding citizens will lose their rights.\nHowever, a public opinion poll in January found that 80 percent of Californians support background checks for ammo deals and that there is significant support increasing gun regulations in other ways. \u00a0\nSome gun policy experts have predicted that these changes will not affect crime rates, as California already has some of the country's strictest gun regulations.\nIt could be especially difficult to enforce collecting magazines holding 10 or more bullets from people who obtained them legally, according to Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\"It will be met with resistance and you will have widespread noncompliance,\" he said.\u00a0\"So in that sense, nothing changes.\"\nPossessing high-capacity magazines is already forbidden in some cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles.\u00a0\nThe possibility for change at the state level comes after Democrats in Congress failed to secure votes on reforms, such as banning gun sales to suspects on terrorist watchlists, despite a high-profile filibuster in the Senate and a sit-in on the House floor.", "title": "California Voters To Consider New Gun Control Measures In November"}
