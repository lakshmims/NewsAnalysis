Bush administration on interrogation methods used on terrorism suspects.\nHerman Schwartz, a law professor at American University in Washington, said if Trump stuck to his proposal for a temporary prohibition on Muslim immigrants, that raises significant constitutional questions and \"shows his shaky command of the legal facts.\"\nMUSLIM BAN\nIn Monday\u2019s speech in New Hampshire, Trump showed little sign of scaling back his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States, which he first laid out in December after an Islamic State-linked deadly mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.\nDebate over the legality of Trump\u2019s proposals was complicated by the vagueness of his pronouncement and questions on how broadly he would extend any immigration ban if elected.\nWhile legal experts say presidents have the power to ban immigrants from specific countries, the United States does not currently ban immigration from any country. Officials do give extra scrutiny to people entering from countries such Syria and Iran.\nUnder the broadest interpretation of Trump\u2019s pronouncement, immigration could be barred not only from the Muslim world but from U.S.-allied countries in Europe and Asia where militant attacks have taken place. This could include India, the source of many skilled engineers for the U.S. technology sector.\nCritics say this would be impractical and counterproductive.\n\u201cIs Mr. Trump proposing to stop issuing visas even for business or tourism or education to nationals of certain countries?\" said Bellinger. \"Rather than increase economic growth, Mr. Trump\u2019s plan could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars.\u201dRepublican Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump foreign policy adviser, justified the candidate\u2019s pronouncement, saying \u201cit is perfectly appropriate for the country to refuse admission to those whose presence may be detrimental to the national interest.\u201c\nBut Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, when asked whether a president has the authority to ban immigrants based on religion, said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure he does.\u201d\nLegal experts also raised doubts about the legality of Trump\u2019s demand that members of the American Muslim community \u201ccooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad\u201d or else they will be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d themselves.\u201d Critics have accused him of anti-Muslim fear-mongering to win votes.\n\u201cGenerally, the idea that knowledge in and of itself comes with criminal liability is antithetical to the way we talk about criminal law in the United States,\u201d said Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor.\nIf Trump tried to implement such prosecutions as president, he said, potential defendants could simply invoke their constitutional right against self-incrimination and continue to remain silent.\n(Additional reporting by Patricia Zengerle, Joan Biskupic and Lawrence Hurley; editing by Stuart Grudgings)", "title": "Trump Doubles Down On Muslim Ban, But Legal Scholars Are Still Doubtful"}
