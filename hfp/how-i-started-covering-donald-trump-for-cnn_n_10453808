I was studying print journalism, and I was interested in financial news and the economy. I got rejected a lot of times.\nI went home and cried after my first meeting with this recruiter at a job fair. She told me I needed more experience in hard news and that I had to read the Wall Street Journal religiously if I ever wanted to work there. I applied to, like, 100 internships every summer trying to make my way into bigger markets. I ended up at The Baltimore Sun and at The Arizona Republic. I wrote the recruiter throughout the year and I made it my goal to track her down at that same job fair every year.", "title": "How I Started Covering Donald Trump For CNN"}
