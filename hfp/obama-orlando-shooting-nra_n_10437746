The group's\u00a0vehement opposition\u00a0to restrictions on even the heaviest weaponry available has allowed people on the no-fly list to buy guns.\"I just came from a meeting today in the situation room, in which I've got people who we know have been on ISIL websites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens,\" Obama said at the town hall, using another name for the Islamic State group. \"And we're allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun.\"\n\"This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer, and if he wants to walk into a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as many weapons and ammunition as he can, nothing's prohibiting him from doing that even though the FBI knows who he is,\" the president said.\nThe scenario Obama described as a possibility has now come true.\u00a0Omar Mateen, 29,\u00a0bought a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun less than a week before he killed around 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida. Mateen had been investigated by the FBI twice\u00a0--\u00a0once in 2013 and again in 2014 -- but was still legally allowed to obtain the weapons.\nMateen had called 911\u00a0on Sunday to say he was affiliated with the Islamic State, although U.S. officials have said there isn't any evidence\u00a0he actually has a direct link to the terrorist group.\u00a0\nThe New York Daily News also lambasted the NRA in its Monday cover story of the shooting. The outlet posted a headline reading \"THANKS NRA\" alongside images of the paper's other pointed front pages from past mass shootings.Despite the president's call for \"common sense\" gun control, there have been\u00a0133 mass U.S. shootings in the 164 days of 2016. The event in Orlando was the deadliest such attack in U.S. history.\nH/T Twitter/RickyFTW", "title": "Obama Warned Two Weeks Ago That Something Like The Orlando Shooting Could Happen"}
