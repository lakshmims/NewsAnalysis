Greg Abbott (R) condemned the decision by arguing that it jeopardizes the state's objective \"to protect innocent life.\"\n\"The decision erodes States\u2019 lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women and subjects more innocent life to being lost,\" he said in a press release. \"Texas' goal is to protect innocent life, while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women.\"In admitting that the law, HB 2, was meant to limit abortions, Abbott deviated from the state's initial justification for the law, as presented during the case's oral arguments. Attorneys for the state noted that the law was implemented in order to \"protect women's health\" and improve safety at abortion clinics. When pressed by the justices, they insisted that\u00a0\u201cabortion is legal and accessible\u201d in Texas.\nHB 2 imposes obstacles on abortion clinics by requiring that they invest in expensive building upgrades to meet the more stringent standards of ambulatory surgical centers, or mini-hospitals. It also mandates that abortion doctors obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Since the law's passage in 2013, the number of abortion providers in the state has\u00a0plummeted from 42 to 19.In Monday's ruling, the Court affirmed that the law presents \"a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion\" and \"an undue burden on abortion access.\"\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion eviscerating the state's argument that the law was passed to protect women's health.\n\u201c[I]t is beyond rational belief that H.B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law \u2018would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners ... at great risk to their health and safety.\u201d\u00a0\nRead more on the case,\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health v.
