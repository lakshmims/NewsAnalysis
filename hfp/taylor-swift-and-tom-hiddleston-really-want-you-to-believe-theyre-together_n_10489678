At one point, the 35-year-old \"Thor\" actor puts his sweater around Swift and rests his head on her shoulder.\u00a0For more photos of the couple, head over to The Sun.\u00a0\nHiddleston and Swift were previously seen dancing together at the Met Gala\u00a0in May, when Swift was still dating Harris (or, at least, they hadn't officially announced their split yet).\n\"I was [at] a table with Taylor Swift, and The Weeknd was playing, and she said, 'The thing about these parties is nobody gets up to dance,'\" Hiddleston recently said.\u00a0\"She, as a musician, was like, 'We've got to dance for The Weeknd.' So we got up and danced.\"It looks like Harris isn't too happy with his ex, as he's already deleted their infamous breakup tweet\u00a0and unfollowed Swift on Twitter. According to Mashable, the DJ reportedly tweeted, \"Oh boy it's about to go down,\" before Swift-ly deleting it.\u00a0Yikes.\u00a0The internet obviously had a field day when photos of Swift and Hiddleston surfaced.\u00a0The Huffington Post has reached out to reps for Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston and will update this post accordingly.\u00a0", "title": "Taylor Swift And Tom Hiddleston Really Want You To Believe They're Together"}
