The photo was captioned, \"They always come back ... \"This photo is incriminating for a lot of reasons.\nFor starters, it comes on the heels of Jenner\u00a0appearing in PARTYNEXTDOOR's latest video for \"Come and See Me.\" Jenner and the rapper kiss passionately in the rain in the video, leading the world to assume the pair are a new couple.Plus,\u00a0as Teen Vogue indicated, it's most definitely not a throwback. Jenner was had the same outfit, hair, and makeup in Tyga's 'gram that she is in one of her own photos that she posted Thursday.What's more is that Kylie has a reddish nose in Tyga's image, which could mean anything, but it likely means she wasn't camera-ready. And that caption?\u00a0Don't even get us started on the caption.\nWho knows what the pair were doing together, but, based on Tyga's quick deletion of the post, it seems like it's not OK that he blew up Kylie's spot.\nCelebrity or not, breakups are messy. The world doesn't always need to be in on it.", "title": "Tyga Instagrammed A Pic Of Kylie Jenner On A Bed And Then Deleted It"}
