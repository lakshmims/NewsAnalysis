The charity angle popped up next.\nCook said he and Lee chose charities working on issues that the porn industry is accused of promoting, including\u00a0sexual assault, rape and revenge porn.\n\"We're also supporting prostate and ovarian cancer research for obvious reasons,\" he said.\nLee and Cook tested the concept before launching the official website earlier this month.\n\"We launched a private version anonymously, and raised $1,000 for charity in a very short time,\" Lee said. \"You can do the math on how many scenes were viewed, but that gave us the confidence to move forward.\"\nThey haven't donated the grand yet, saying the business model is set up for annual donations.\nHowever, Lee and Cook did show HuffPost documents that prove they donated one day's worth of penny-per-stream profits to their three chosen charities.\nThat worked out to $38.92. The duo generously rounded up to $39, so each charity got $13 from \"IJustCame.\"\nCook and Lee are currently making the donations out of their own pockets, but Cook said their business model is to get brands to sponsor each orgasm.\n\"Users will see the brand's logo and ad copy after they click the \"IJustCame\" button on the website,\" he said. \"For brands, this means that they have the user's attention at the height of their attention and dopamine levels after they orgasm, which is a pretty big deal.\"\nIf things works out the way they hope, Lee said the website has the potential to donate millions of dollars to charity each year.\u00a0Still, it remains to be seen whether the chosen organizations want money from a porn website.\nHuffPost contacted each of the organizations to get their reaction to the new site, but none of them had heard of it.\u00a0A spokeswoman for the Joyful Heart Foundation said they have\u00a0\"turned the matter over to counsel for further review.\" The other two groups did not want to comment.\nSo is it a scam or a scheme? Michael Montgomery, a Michigan-based fundraising and nonprofit consultant, leans towards the latter.\n\"I don\u2019t think they would be calling broader media attention to this if they were not planning to make the promised contributions,\" Montgomery told HuffPost. \"However,\u00a0a single cent contribution is an unusually -- even bizarrely -- small charitable contribution to make in recognition of a person undertaking any requested action.\"\nMontgomery also believes IJustCame.org may actually be hurting their chosen charities by engaging in business activities that other potential donors\u00a0might find distasteful.\n\"It could actually deter others from giving,\" Montgomery said. \"The well-intentioned donor doing business in a pariah industry just quietly sends in a contribution check without doing their own publicity about that gift or asking for public donor recognition from the recipient charity.\"", "title": "Porn Website Promises To Donate To Charity When Viewers Masturbate"}
