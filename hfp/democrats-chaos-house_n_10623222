Throughout the day, Democrats clogged the House floor, holding the printed names of gun victims over their heads and loudly chanting \"No Bill, No Break.\" Democrats were protesting the Republicans' refusal to take up the so-called No Fly, No Buy legislation, which would bar people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns.\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) gaveled the House back into session, nearly 11 hours after the Democratic sit-in began. He read a prepared script to set up a procedural vote, as if the House was in order and that Democrats weren't breaking rules.\nWhen Ryan stepped down from the podium, Democrats chanted \"Shame!\"\nAs the vote progressed, Rep.\u00a0Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) tried to address the House.\n\"To my Republican friends,\" Deutch began. But Republicans shouted Deutch down and didn't let him speak.\nEventually, Democrats sang in response, \"We Shall Overcome.\"\nThe singing was interrupted when presiding officer Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) called the vote. That prompted Democrats to chant: \"Give us a vote!\"\nThe scene capped a day of tumult.\nAt the end of the vote series, Democrats and Republicans lingered on the House floor, unsure what would happen next.\nDemocrats broke into sporadic chants of \"Shame!\" and \"No Bill, No Break.\"\u00a0Eventually, they returned to making speeches at the podium, giving no signal they would stop their occupation of the House floor.\nSome Republicans hung around, occasionally shouting at them. Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) antagonized Democrats for not having a plan to fight terrorism, and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) started yelling.\n\"Radical Islam killed these people!\" Gohmert shouted, pointing to a poster of gun violence victims from Orlando.\nGohmert even got into a shouting match with Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.), which other Democrats and Republicans had to break up.\u00a0\nThe protests continued overnight, with Democrats sharing stories of gun violence victims and railing against their counterparts' \"cowardice.\" Even after the Republicans voted in the middle of the night to adjourn until after the July 4 holiday,\u00a0Democrats remained on the floor, fighting for a vote on gun control measures.\nRead more:\nDemocrats Stage Sit-In On House Floor Over Gun Bills\nProtesters Gather Outside U.S. Capitol To Push For Vote On Guns\nSenate Democrats Bring Food To Support House Colleagues Conducting Sit-In On Gun Laws\nDemocrats Finally Tried To Do Something About The Gun Bloodshed\nDemocrats Cause Chaos On House Floor As Republicans Pretend Everything Is Fine\nYou Will Never Be As Ecstatic As This Woman Delivering Pizzas To Rep.
