Mississippi is among a handful of Southern U.S. states on the front lines of legal battles over equality, privacy and religious freedom.\nReeves has not yet ruled on other provisions of the state legislation, which is expected to become law on Friday and also contains a set of religious objections provisions that have been challenged in four separate lawsuits.\nBut Mississippi's lieutenant governor, Tate Reeves, quickly slammed the ruling in a written statement.\n\"If this opinion by the federal court denies even one Mississippian of their fundamental right to practice their religion, then all Mississippians are denied their 1st Amendment rights,\u201d Reeves said. \"I hope the state\u2019s attorneys will quickly appeal this decision to the 5th Circuit to protect the deeply held religious beliefs of all Mississippians.\"\nA spokesman for the Campaign for Southern Equality, meanwhile, said the group was \"delighted\" with the decision and expected the judge to rule in their favor on its challenges to the entirety of the HB 1523.\n(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Bernard Orr)", "title": "Judge Rules Mississippi Clerks Can't Use Religious Beliefs To Deny Same-Sex Marriage Licenses"}
