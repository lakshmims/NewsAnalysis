Even on shoots, I would never have options for clothing. There would always be this attention on Kourtney and Kim, but I was too much work for [stylists] or they had nothing in my size. I wasn't even that crazy big!\" she said.Kardashian has long credited her style to Monica Rose, who has worked with the family over the years and, according to Kardashian, always made her \"feel special,\" regardless of her size. \"Other people actually said, 'I just can't work with you,' because I was too big. That always hurt my feelings, of course.\"\u00a0\nBut as any devoted Khloe fan kan tell you, the media mogul was famous for her unfiltered approach long before she was famous for her skintight ensembles. When asked about those stylists who now want to dress her 40 pounds later, \"I'm just like, 'Fuck you,'\" she said. \"'I'm not going to reward your bad behavior.'\"\u00a0\nSo, basically, she's the iconic shopping scene\u00a0from \"Pretty Woman,\" and we salute her for it.\u00a0Head to Harper's Bazaar to see the rest of the gorgeous shoot.\u00a0", "title": "A Toned-Down Khloe Kardashian Has A Powerful Message For The Stylists Who Rejected Her"}
