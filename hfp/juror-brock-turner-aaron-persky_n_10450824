We were unanimous in our finding of the defendant's guilt and our verdicts were marginalized based on your own personal opinion.\u201d\u00a0Turner was arrested on Jan. 18, 2015 after two Stanford graduate students who were cycling by an on-campus frat party spotted him \u201cthrusting his hips atop an unconscious woman lying on the ground.\u201d\u00a0\nOne of the grad students allegedly shouted at Turner, prompting him to jump off the victim\u00a0(referred to in the letter as Emily Doe). The student then pursued Turner, who ran from the scene.\nTurner was convicted of three felony sex abuse charges in March. He was subsequently sentenced to six months in county jail, but will likely only serve three.\nIn justifying the light sentence, Persky said Turner\u2019s age and lack of criminal history factored into his decision.\n\u201cA prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,\u201d said the judge. \u201cI think he will not be a danger to others.\u201d\nPersky has faced mounting criticism since the sentencing. Over 1.2 million people\u00a0signed a petition calling for the judge\u2019s removal\u00a0from the bench and reports have emerged of prospective jurors boycotting his cases.\nIn the letter to Persky, the unnamed juror in the Turner case slammed the judge for perpetuating a culture that fails to protect survivors of sexual assault.\n\u201cJustice has not been served in this case,\u201d the juror wrote. \u201cThe jury's verdict of guilt on all three felony counts of sexual assault was completely disregarded in an effort to spare the perpetrator a 'hardship.' What message does this send to Emily Doe, and indeed all victims of sexual assault and rape, especially those on college campuses? Your concern was for the impact on the assailant. I vehemently disagree, our concern should be for the victim.\u201d", "title": "Brock Turner Juror Skewers 'Lenient' Judge Aaron Persky In Letter: 'Shame On You'"}
