A new GoPro clip posted on YouTube shows\u00a0Casey Anderson, co-owner and director of the sanctuary,\u00a0teaching Bella about space and boundaries.\nWatch him swing Bella around like a teddy bear\u00a0(one that even as a cub could probably inflict some serious damage if she wanted to):\u00a0Anderson writes on his website that all of the bears at the sanctuary \"were born in unfortunate captive situations and could NEVER be released into the wild. The bears have been rescued from often inhumane captive situations all over the U.S.\"\u00a0\nSomeday, probably very soon, Bella will become one of nature's most efficient killing machines.\u00a0But for now, check out those little bear feet:\u00a0Along with running the sanctuary, Anderson is also host and executive producer of\u00a0\"Expedition Wild\" and \"America the Wild\" on Nat Geo WILD. \u00a0In other words, he's a bear professional, so do not under any circumstances try this on your own.\n\u00a0\n(h/t Mashable)", "title": "Watch As Casey Anderson Tickles A Grizzly Bear's Feet...
