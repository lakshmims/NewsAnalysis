For the \"Leave\" camp the racers are 'Boar-is Johnson' and 'Iain Duncan Sniff', a reference to leading Eurosceptic and Conservative ex-cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith.\nMonday kicked off the farm's first \"referendum race\" despite dense fog hanging over the track.\n\"I think this is most appropriate weather for this occasion,\" Pennywell Farm owner Chris Murray said.\n\"It's a murky question, we are all in the fog about it and I think that these little Pennywell miniature pigs will actually find a way through this fog of confusion and indecisiveness.\"\nThe track features jumps named \"Bacon Brook\" and \"The Trough\", leading to the finish that consists of two Union Jack and EU-themed gates.\nOnce the starting gate was opened, spectators cheered as David Hameron, George Hogsborne and Iain Duncan Sniff rushed off, easily clearing the hurdles, while Boar-is Johnson trailed behind. The result in the end was decisive. \n\"We've had three votes for staying in the EU and just one for leaving,\" the race compere announced.\nPennywell Farm will conduct the races daily up until the vote.\n(Reporting By Reuters Television; Writing by Georgina Cooper and Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "title": "Pigs Go Whole Hog In Race To Predict Brexit Outcome"}
