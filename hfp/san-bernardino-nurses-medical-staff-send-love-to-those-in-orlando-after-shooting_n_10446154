It was comforting to know ...\u00a0that we had the support of people across the nation,\" William West, an ARMC nurse who helped come up with the show of support, told The Huffington Post. \"We wanted the health care workers in Orlando to know we were thinking of them as they navigated this very trying time.\"\nThe photos, which were posted on social media, featured nurses, physicians, clerks, ER techs and more. West, along with another nurse, Rima Sagala, organized the photos,\u00a0and were compelled to do something for the staff at ORMC after learning that the facility took in many of the victims.\nSagala, who was abroad at the time of the December tragedy, told HuffPost that another hospital had sent pizza to ARMC staff during that trying time.\u00a0ARMC initially wanted to pay it forward and do the same for those in Orlando. However they discovered that ORMC wasn't accepting food donations at the time,\u00a0so they decided to send some virtual love.\u00a0\nWest, who was stationed in the trauma room as San Bernardino victims began arriving to the ARMC, noted that especially during a tough time like this, those in health care need our kindness.\u00a0\n\"These people are charged with doing everything they can to save the victims' lives, and they invest so much time and energy,\" he said. \"It can be emotionally draining, and just having someone there to offer encouragement can be a huge morale booster.\"\nAnd though they're across the country, Sagala said that ARMC is committed being there for those in Orlando. She said the staff plan to try and organize another act of generosity for ORMC in the coming weeks.\u00a0\n\"We know we're not close by but if there's anything that they could use from us, we'll try to support them as much as we can,\" she said.\u00a0\u00a0\nH/T USA Today", "title": "San Bernardino Nurses, Medical Staff Send Love To Orlando Hospital After Shooting"}
