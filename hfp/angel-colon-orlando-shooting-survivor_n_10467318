According to Colon, alleged shooter Omar Mateen gunned down clubgoers multiple times with deadly intent.\u00a0\n\"I hear [the gunman]\u00a0come back and he's shooting everyone that's already dead on the floor, making sure they're dead,\" he told reporters at Orlando Regional Medical Center, where 16 remain in stable condition\u00a0and another six are considered critical.\nRecalling the shooting, Colon said he played dead -- lying motionless on the ground -- but didn't think he'd make it out alive.\u00a0\n\"I look over and he shoots the girl next to me. And I'm just there lying down thinking, 'I'm next. I'm dead,'\" he said. \"But by the glory of God, he shoots towards my head, but it hits my hand. And he shoots me again and it hits this side of my hip. I had no reaction, I was just prepared to just stay there, laying down, so he won't know that I'm alive.\"\u00a0\nThen the police entered the venue,\u00a0Colon recounted. Since he couldn't walk, an officer dragged Colon out of the club, broken glass slicing him as he was taken to safety.\u00a0\n\"I'm grateful for [the officer], but the floor [was] just covered in glass. So he's dragging me out while I'm just getting cut,\" Colon said. \"I don't feel pain, but I just feel all this blood on me from myself, from other people. And he just drops me off across the street and I look over and there's just bodies everywhere.\"\u00a0\nColon is still recovering and can't yet walk, however he is staying optimistic.\u00a0\n\"As long as I have a smile on my face and have that love that I feel, I'll be okay.\" he said.\u00a0\nHear Colon's words in the video above.\u00a0", "title": "Orlando Survivor Describes Horrific Scene At Pulse Nightclub Shooting"}
