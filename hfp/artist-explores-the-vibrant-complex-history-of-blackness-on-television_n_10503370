However, Adams' tone is far from one of judgmental alarm.\nHe's not calling for the death of television, that newfangled opiate of the masses.\u00a0Rather, Adams likes TV; he watches TV and considers his work in conversation with it. His vibrant art mimics television's fast pace, its addictive visuals and exaggerated postures. Adams doesn't condemn the culture and cult of television, he simply explores it intensely and with critical fascination. \"A lot of the things I make are about trying to connect the dots and figure out why and how am I who I am, based on media output and the things around me when I grew up,\" Adams said.\u00a0In his current exhibition \"ON,\" now on view at Pioneer Works, Adams decked out the massive Brooklyn warehouse space with nine large-scale, mixed-media wall hangings. The sculptural objects resemble supersized old school television sets, with collaged fabrics covering the screen, recalling SMPTE color bars.\nWhile many organize their living rooms around a television set, Adams takes the concept to surreal, exaggerated heights, mounting a rainbow temple honoring and challenging the ubiquitous media machine.\u00a0The TVs' collaged insides are made from fabrics purchased on Bed-Stuy's Fulton Street, strips of African dashikis and mass-produced patterned textiles. Adams transforms the banality of the television set into something colossal, complex, all-consuming -- qualities television perhaps possessed all along.\u00a0\n\"Even if you don\u2019t watch TV, you are informed by other people around you who watch it,\" he said. \"I see how things on television become structures for the way people live, the things people aspire to and desire, how religion does. It creates a desire and need and spirituality that is informed by consumerism. People feel at ease when they have a house that looks like a house on television, or when you get something from a commercial that you like and want. We can\u2019t see a world without TV, there is no way. You have to embrace it and figure out how to navigate through it.\"\nFor Adams, the journey began in childhood, with shows like \"Sesame Street,\" \"The Muppets,\" \"The Electric Company\" and \"Schoolhouse Rock.\" The structure of such television shows, the way they blurred the line between education and entertainment for children at such a young age, interests Adams. As he repeats throughout our conversation, \"I'm not saying it's good, I'm not saying it's bad.\" It just is.\u00a0Another unique aspect of 1970s and '80s educational television programs is the fact that so many actors in the shows had rich roles, lives and passions outside of their characters. For example, Rita Moreno and Morgan Freeman both appeared on \"The Electric Company,\" but were, at the same time, appearing in other movies and serving as sociopolitical activists outside of their roles. They publicly spoke about issues of race, gender and politics -- even when a camera wasn't rolling. \"Nowadays TV allows you to perform politics without actually being outspoken about anything,\" Adams said.\n\"TV now allows performers to be radical, but their radicalism is only displayed in music videos. They never have to actually say anything outside of the script. I don\u2019t think of this as a negative or positive, but it's an interesting shift,\" Adams added. \"These older performers were outspoken activists who spoke publicly about human rights. Today you rarely see entertainers speaking publicly on issues unless it's done on a commercial.\"\nAdams referenced a celebrity PSA calling for gun control\u00a0that's been making the rounds online following the tragic Orlando shooting. In the heavily stylized video,\u00a0short clips of celebrities in a studio are spliced together in black-and-white to create an author-less message. \"How many more classrooms\" asks Rashida Jones. \"How many more movie theaters\" chimes in Will Ferrell. \"How many more houses of faith?\" says Sarah Silverman.\u00a0\n\"They\u2019re speaking about politics in this extremely edited type of way,\" Adams said. \"As an artist in this contemporary culture, I\u2019m interested in adapting these tactics that have become so common in today\u2019s culture. Media has such a big influence on the psyche of the citizens, you can\u2019t reject TV. You have to negotiate with it, learn how to combine entertainment with learning. TV is a learning tool.\u00a0I just want to redirect the conversation.\"I ask Adams if he watches \"UnREAL,\" the Lifetime drama that mimics the addictive entertaining aspects of reality TV shows like \"The Bachelor\" while critiquing their structures and delving into their sinister behind-the-scenes methodologies. To Adams, shows like this reveal TV's truly invincible powers.\u00a0\"You know TV is untouchable when it can make fun of itself without changing anything,\" he said. \"When you get to be so structurally institutional, you can criticize yourself within the very formula you're criticizing.\"\nAdams ultimately describes his personal relationship to television as a \"love-hate\" one. His favorite genre is science fiction, and he's often amused and frustrated by how much writers revert to racial stereotypes, past histories and tired generalizations in shows meant to depict the limitless future. \"You think they'd be compelled to imagine the future world they want to live in, rather than reenforce media stereotypes. It's a futuristic show -- why are you talking about slavery? Use your imagination!\"\u00a0\nHe has similar complaints about \"Game of Thrones,\" which, despite existing in a alternate universe, features only white people in positions of power. \"None of the seven kingdoms are non-white,\" Adams said. \"It\u2019s supposed to be a fantastical, fairy tale story but it\u2019s still borrowing from the same, preconceived racial dynamics that have informed all of Hollywood television.\"\nAnd as for the black characters that do appear in mainstream television, they're often of a very particular disposition: loud, funny, exaggerated, over the top. According to Adams, such archetypal characters first appeared as minor roles in 1970s black comedies like \"The Jeffersons,\" \"All in the Family,\" and \"Diff'rent Strokes.\" Roles like Arnold from \"Diff'rent Strokes,\" known for his goofy temperament and knack for serving up catchphrases like \"Whatcha talkin' bout Willis?\" soon became the shows' unexpected stars.\u00a0When the next round of sitcoms came around, with '90s shows like \"Martin,\" and \"In Living Color,\" the networks put these hyperbolic caricatures of blackness in the starring roles. There's nothing wrong with featuring so many over-the-top personalities, Adams said, except that\u00a0\"for some people watching these shows, that\u2019s the only representation of black people they have. These characters become representations of the black personality.\"\nThere are other common ways blackness is portrayed in mainstream media, all equally stereotypical. There's the old, wise, mystical, black woman -- a Miss Cleo type -- and her male counterpart -- think Morpheus of \"The Matrix\" or way too many of Morgan Freeman's roles. There's the sassy, Southern, black matriarch, like \"Annie the Chicken Queen\" who constantly appeared in Popeye's chicken commercials, described by radio station 104.7 as \"a straight-talking, feisty Southern woman telling it like it is about her chicken.\"\nIn commercials such as these, Adams explained, blackness is being used as a commodity, a marketing technique to help push products. \"It makes the chicken seem more authentic,\" he said. \"Fried chicken is so racially and stereotypically connected to black culture, featuring a black woman makes the product seem more genuine or something.\"\u00a0For a performance on the opening night of his exhibition, Adams wanted to allude to these performed notions of blackness while ensuring the piece had a sense of spontaneity lacking from most televised programs. He recruited performers using an open call, looking for black, outgoing, creative types\u00a0--\u00a0but not actors -- to toy with the conventions of blackness on screen. He gave each participant a labelled box, with unknown contents, and gave them a single instruction: \"Take the box and sell it.\"\nThe performers were guided to mimic black screen presences they grew up with and knew well, from George Foreman peddling his grill on an infomercial to Will Smith on \"The Fresh Prince.\" The participants were instructed to sell their blackness to sell a product, using their funky style, uninhibited personalities and whatever black tropes they could muster up to their advantage. \"Everyone was like, 'Oh I know how to do that!'\" Adams said.\u00a0\nThe result is a kaleidoscopic mishmash of exaggerated mainstream blackness, subverted and made strange by the intensity of the format. Imagine splicing together scenes from sitcoms and infomercials while watching them at twice their intended speed, in a giant rainbow space. \"I wanted to show the media bombardment of black representation and black performative gestures and mannerisms all happening very quickly at the same time,\" Adams put it. \"It becomes something fragmented, distorted, overly expressive, this bombarding form of personality.\"\nThrough \"ON,\" Adams toys with the language of television, exaggerating the exaggerations, to reveal the stereotypes and structures we so often take for granted, and end up mistaking for reality. Adams works from the inside, using television's own language to point out the insidious ways media is carefully designed to shape our identities and desires.\u00a0\nAdams' work celebrates television more than it criticizes it, though, mostly because the artist comes from an undeniably positive point of view. \"I'm not really interested in being negative,\" he said. \"I like all these black figures who are over the top. I want to celebrate them.\" The celebration, however, comes with a caveat. \"The people who are more critical of television and its structures are those who are constantly in contact with different types of people,\" he explained. \"That\u2019s the only way to break with the fantastical world of TV -- to come into contact with the people represented on TV in a real way. TV is just gonna be TV.\u00a0It can't provide enlightenment when it comes to reality.\"\nIf grown viewers leave his exhibition looking at their television set with a more cautious eye, Adams will be pleased. It's also key that kids dig the art. \"If a kid likes my show I feel that\u2019s success,\" Adams said. He talks of the SMPTE color bars' resemblance to the color spectrums and grids often employed in elementary school classrooms.\nThe overlap of entertainment and education shapes children's minds from a young age. Perhaps, if art is in thrown into the mix,\u00a0it can help give the almighty powers of television a run for its money. But even if the children just think the work looks cool, that's good too.\u00a0\n\"Kids are the future,\" Adams concluded. \"That\u2019s what I think about when I\u2019m making stuff, the future.\"\nDerrick Adams' \"ON\" runs until July 17, 2016 at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn.", "title": "Artist Explores The Vibrant, Complex History Of Blackness On Television"}
