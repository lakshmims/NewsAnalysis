The police department reported 13 arrests in the early stages of a street march led by labor unions.\nAfter violent clashes between riot police and masked youths during previous demonstrations,\u00a0Paris police had feared further incidents and banned 130 would-be troublemakers before Tuesday's rally even began.\nIt was not immediately clear which group, if any, the youths belonged to. The government and police have condemned what they say are groups of ultra-violent youths who join protests looking for a fight.\nTuesday's march comes at a time when police are stretched to ensure security during the month-long Euro soccer tournament, with France on maximum alert since Islamist militants killed 130 people in November.\nThe CGT labor union said the march would be the biggest show of strength since protests over the planned labor reform began in early March.\n\"This is not the end,\" CGT leader Philippe Martinez said. \"The struggle is far from over.\"\nThe CGT, backed by smaller unions in a campaign of strikes and protests, is sparring for pole position with another big union that backs the reform that would also devolve setting of pay and working conditions more extensively to company level.\nAbout 700 buses ferried protesters to the capital from all over France for the march, Martinez said. Smaller protests were being staged in other cities.\nPolice planning was based on the possibility that more than 50,000 - twice previous levels - would take part, Paris Police Prefect Michel Cadot told a pre-rally news conference.\nOn many previous occasions, gangs of what the government and police have described as ultra-violent youths have engaged in running battles with law enforcement officers, ransacking shopfronts and street furniture.\nIn tandem with Tuesday's protest, workers stopped work at the state-owned SNCF rail company, which nevertheless said disruption was far less than at the outset of a rolling strike two weeks ago or on previous occasions this year.\n\n\u00a0\nNinety percent of high-speed connections were operating and other services were working at about 70 percent, the SNCF said.\nThe CGT union and smaller Force Ouvriere union argue that the reform will undermine standards of labor protection.\nThe government, and the large CFDT union argue the contrary, saying it will help tackle a jobless rate of 10 percent and also develop labor representation at grassroots level. Youth unemployment is about 24 percent.\nPresident Francois Hollande's Socialist government has refused to withdraw the reform. It forced it through the lower house of parliament by decree last month and aims to make it law by July.\nOpinion polls have suggested as many as 80 percent of voters are unhappy with it but they also suggest the protest movement no longer enjoys the backing of a majority of the French people.\n(Reporting by Brian Love; Editing by Alison Williams)\n", "title": "Paris Police Clash With Protesters As Thousands Rally Against Labor Law"}
