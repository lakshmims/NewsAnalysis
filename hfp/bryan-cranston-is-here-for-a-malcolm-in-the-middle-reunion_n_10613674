News that he would be down for a \"Malcolm in the Middle\" reunion while at the Maui Film Festival.\u00a0\n\"I really do, for no other reason than that I miss those people like crazy and I stay in touch with them. The boys are doing great and Jane [Kaczmarek] is doing wonderfully and I'd love to,\" Cranston said.\u00a0\nThe series, which ran from 2000-2006, starred fan-favorite Frankie Muniz as Malcolm. Considering his last few screen credits involve the word \"Sharknado,\" we think Muniz would be equally excited to return to his place in the \"Middle.\"\u00a0\n\"There's a possibility we want to start talking about the possibility of putting together a story that makes sense about that family 10 years or 12 years later,\" Cranston said.\u00a0\nThe show would be the latest in a series of old TV hits (\"The X-Files,\" \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"Fuller House\") to get the green light for a reboot/reunion.\u00a0\nNetflix, are you listening?\u00a0", "title": "Bryan Cranston Is Here For A 'Malcolm In The Middle' Reunion"}
