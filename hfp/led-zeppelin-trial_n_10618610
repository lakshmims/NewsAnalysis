The musician drowned in 1997.\nEarlier in the trial, Skidmore's lawyers simultaneously showed the jury two video clips of expert Kevin Hanson playing the riff in both songs. Hanson said the two clips \"play together as one piece of music. It is not discordant.\"\nLed Zeppelin's attorneys brought in music expert Lawrence Ferrara, who testified that the \"descending chromatic minor line progression\" in question at the trial was used 300 years ago, as well as in many pop songs since.\n(Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "title": "Led Zeppelin Owes Millions In Royalties To Musician, Plaintiff Argues"}
