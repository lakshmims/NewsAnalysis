In the video, a father shares his anxoius reaction to learning his first child would be a girl. But, he says, \"It turns out having a daughter is the best thing that has ever happened to me, hands down.\"\nAddressing dads who worry they aren't prepared to raise daughters, he explains, \"My girls and I, we do science experiments and we build cities out of bricks and we go to games and we play a little air guitar AND we bake cookies -- because cookies are awesome and so are daughters.\"\nOther videos from the series include \"Dear Dad Of A Picky Eater\" and \"Dear Dad Who isn't Sure Where To Look During Labor.\"\nSounds like #ParentingUnfiltered indeed.", "title": "This Goes Out To Dads Who Are Nervous About Raising Daughters"}
