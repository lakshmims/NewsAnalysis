Hate wants us to be too weak to change anything,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLove does not despair. Love makes us strong. Love gives us the courage to act. Love gives us hope that change is possible. Loves allows us to change the script,\u201d he said. \u201cSo love your country. Love your family, love the families and the victims and the people of Orlando, but remember that love is a verb and to love means to do something.\u201dColbert joined the voices of several other talk show hosts who took time out of their programs to condemn the violence.\n\u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon reflected on his two young daughters, asking: \u201cWhat if my kids are gay? What do I tell them?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a lesson from all this, a lesson in tolerance. We need to support each other\u2019s differences and worry less about our own opinions,\u201d he went on.\nConan O'Brien, for his part, addressed gun control, particularly the importance of limiting the sale of semi-automatic assault rifles like the one used by Sunday\u2019s gunman.\u201cI simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semi-automatic assault rifle. It makes no sense to me. These are weapons of war, and they have no place in civilian life,\u201d he said.\nLater in his program, Colbert interviewed Fox News commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly. They discussed Donald Trump\u2019s response to the mass shooting, which he used to further his problematic calls to prevent Muslims from entering the U.S.", "title": "Stephen Colbert Urges America To Love In The Face Of Horror"}
