Run and his wife, Justine Simmons.\nAfter discovering that both of their families have a history of type 2 diabetes,\u00a0the pair decided to take action. So they partnered with leading diabetes care organization, Novo Nordisk and its Ask.Screen.Know national program\u00a0to inform Americans about the importance of finding out about their risk levels and getting early screenings for type 2 diabetes.\nThe Run\u2013D.M.C. member wants to encourage Americans through his various public platforms and promotional campaigns\u00a0to visit the Ask.Screen.Know. website to take the Diabetes Risk Factor Assessment. He said he's \u201chappy\u201d to advocate for awareness surrounding the\u00a0chronic condition, especially as it pertains to the African-American community.\n\u201cAs a spiritual man, I believe it was my time to start speaking about health along with the other messages that I was delivering to people on social media. So it was a perfect match -- it was time,\u201d he said to The Huffington Post. \u201cAnd it helped me a lot. It changed my lifestyle. So it became very spiritual to me.\u201d\nThe 51-year-old went on to add that since the partnership he has discovered that people who aren\u2019t obese and physically fit can also get diabetes just from their family history.\nAs a way to combat and possibly prevent diabetes, Justine wants to encourage Americans to request a screening for diabetes during annual checkups.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to do, is let a lot of people know that you don\u2019t have to have diabetes or be at risk,\u201d she said to HuffPost. \u201cYou have to ask when you go to the doctors, don\u2019t just say \u2018give me a checkup,\u2019 you have to ask to get a checkup for diabetes.\u201d\u00a0All patients should be screened for diabetes at three-year intervals beginning at age 45, however if multiple risk factors are present -- such as obesity, family history of diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol -- screening should be done at an earlier age and more frequently,\u00a0according to the American Diabetes Association.\nCoupled with the fact that African-Americans are twice as likely to develop diabetes compared to Caucasians, the pair has taken preemptive action with their own family. This has resulted in a \u201cfamily effort\u201d to manage a well-balanced diet and become more active through fitness activities.\nAs for encouraging the black community to become more conscious about their overall health and well-being, Run says he has opted for a non-passive approach through his television shows like \u201cRev. Run\u2019s Sunday Suppers\u201d and social media platforms.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to force people really hard in one direction, I like to show them what\u2019s going on, give them their options. So for me, I\u2019ve never been one to slam people,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for me, my tactics -- and they\u2019re not conscious -- are, 'OK, you see what I\u2019m cooking on my show, you see what I\u2019m talking about on Instagram, and all these different social media posts, so you kind of fall in place and know that it\u2019s organic to me.\u201d\nFor more information on diabetes and the \u201cAsk.Screen.Know\u201d program click here.
