Black lives alone with Barbara, a woman who says she has legal custody of Black, though there are conflicting reports as to whether she is his mother or grandmother. Barbara is disabled and gets social security but not food stamps.\nWhite decided to buy Black donuts and few bags worth of groceries, including essentials like milk, soap and toothbrushes. While they shopped, White found out that the teen is a straight-A student and wanted to one day own his own a business \u201cso that he could help other people in his neighborhood and buy them groceries like me,\u201d White wrote in the post.\nAfter the two were done shopping, White offered to drive Black home and discovered that not only did the teen and Barbara have nothing to eat, they didn\u2019t have much of anything at all in their south Memphis rental home.\n\u201cThey didn't even have beds or furniture. They were sleeping on pads made out of sleeping bags, they had two lamps and nothing in their fridge. Nothing,\u201d White wrote.\nInspired by Black\u2019s attitude, White came home and wrote about it in the post that has since gone viral. In the comments of the post, some suggested that White create a GoFundMe page to help Black\u00a0\u2014 so on June 13, he did.At first, White humbly asked for $250 to get Black an ID -- so he could apply for jobs -- and to buy a lawn mower -- so Black could start his own business cutting grass.\nIn just a few hours, White had reached that goal.\nKnowing just a little more money could make a big difference for Black and Barbara, White raised the goal to $500 and also asked for clothing and furniture donations. The $500 goal was reached on June 15, along with pledges for donations \u2014 including furniture and a free lawn mower for the teen to use.White decided to raise the goal again, and again and again. As of Friday, the fundraiser had garnered over $72,000 for the small family.\n\u201cI cannot explain what is happening. It's beyond words,\u201d White wrote on the GoFundMe page. \u201cI didn't know this much love could exist in one place, be aimed in one direction, but seen and felt and empowered by so many people.\u201d\nAnd Black gets right down to the root of it:\n\u201cI\u2019m SO happy!\u201d he enthusiastically in a video\u00a0that White posted to the GoFundMe page.\nThe current goal is to raise $73,000, which is enough money to buy Black and Barbara their own home.\nIf you would like to donate, check out their GoFundMe page, here.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Matt White as Mike White.
