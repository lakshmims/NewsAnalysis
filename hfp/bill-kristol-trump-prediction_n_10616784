The mission is daring, a high-wire act with no real certainty of success. To pull it off, the anti-Trump delegate cabal would need quite a bit of help. Here's something they don't need however:Noooooo, Bill Kristol! My man! You have\u00a0one\u00a0job and that's to never offer up predictions. You know this! I mean, look at this nonsense. You are currently competing with ESPN's Steven A. Smith in a desperate battle to see whose oracular abilities are the most star-crossed.\u00a0\nAs The Washington Post's Paul Farhi noted back in February, a black swan event occurred in the lead-up to the GOP primary season:\u00a0Kristol managed to make two accurate predictions. The Weekly Standard's standard-bearer correctly saw that Rand Paul was not going to succeed in the Republicans' crowded presidential field, and -- in a genuinely nervy moment -- he accurately foretold that Jeb Bush would not win his party's nomination either.\u00a0\u201cI think there\u2019s no way there will be a Bush-Clinton race in 2016,\u201d he said, in a moment of prescience that rarely comes his way.\nMost of the time, however, Kristol's prognostications portend doom for whatever enterprises he seeks to anoint. What he should be doing now is basking in his momentary success and properly anticipating that a reversion to the mean was in the offing. Instead, he's gone all out,\u00a0predicting that GOP chair Reince Priebus\u00a0--\u00a0who's hitherto demonstrated the fortitude of a box kite trapped in a heavy wind -- will provide the anti-Trump effort with the steely leadership it needs to succeed.\nOh well, R.I.P., Stop Trump Movement.~~~~~\nJason Linkins edits \u201cEat The Press\u201d for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast \u201cSo, That Happened.\u201d Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.", "title": "Bill Kristol's Tweet Dooms Effort To Thwart Trump At Convention"}
