The song \"Sorry\" shocked and stumped the Beyhive with the lyrics,\u00a0\"He better call Becky with the good hair.\"\u00a0\nFirst, Rachel Roy was the target (which caused a confused Rachael Ray to be thrust into the discussion) before the title was given to Rita Ora. But, alas, the actual\u00a0\"Becky with the good hair\"\u00a0has never been discovered ...\u00a0\n... Until now?Under this popcorn bucket is the true Becky everyone should \"call\"\u00a0-- and she stars in Disney and Pixar's latest flick, \"Finding Dory.\"\u00a0Drumroll please ...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's Becky, the loon bird, with the good hair!As of the time of publication, Bey's representatives haven't confirmed or denied if this is the Becky from the song.\u00a0But could it actually be her?If it is, we may just be misinterpreting Bey's song. Becky is called to help Marlin and Nemo get out of a jam, so that could be the reason Jay Z would need to call her, as well.\nWhether she's Bey's Becky or not, this loon bird is the highlight of the sequel to 2003's \"Finding Nemo.\" She saves the day more than once and is readily available whenever Marlin comes a' bird callin'. Plus, she's probably always there for Nemo when he says,\u00a0\"Oh my God, Becky. Look at that boat.\"How could you ever be mad at Becky? And let's be honest, her hair is on fleek.\u00a0\"Finding Dory\" just keeps swimming into theaters June 17.", "title": "We Found 'Becky With The Good Hair' In the Unlikeliest Of Places"}
