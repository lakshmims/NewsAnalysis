Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who has a long track record of urging compassion for animals,\u00a0spearheaded the animal testing provision. In recent years he has co-sponsored acts strengthening laws against soring show horses -- the practice of inflicting pain to a horse's legs so that they walk with a higher gait -- and banning horse slaughtering.\nThe Dodo noted he also opposed the Sportmen's Act last year, which would have \"lowered protections for federal lands and wilderness areas, encouraged hunting of threatened polar bears and blocked checks on toxic lead ammunition, which can hurt animals and the environment.\"", "title": "The U.S. Takes Action To Minimize Animal Testing"}
