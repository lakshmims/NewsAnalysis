After a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, Trump called for a complete immigration ban from countries with a history of terrorism against the United States. But on Saturday, Trump shifted, telling CNN's Jeremy Diamond he only wanted to focus on \"people coming from the terror states.\" Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, also told Diamond that Trump no longer supports a blanket ban\u00a0and only wants to ban Muslims from terror states.\nIt's unclear which countries, exactly, this applies to.\u00a0The three countries on the State Department's official list of state sponsors of terrorism are Syria, Iran and Sudan, but terrorist groups are complex organizations that can have members in several countries, including U.S. allies. Several of the suspected terrorists involved in the Paris attacks, for example, were French nationals. Two of the brothers involved in the March Brussels attack were Belgian-born.\nHicks did not respond to an additional request for comment from The Huffington Post.\nAlso on Saturday, Trump declined to characterize his\u00a0mass deportation plan as such, despite having put forward\u00a0an immigration plan\u00a0focused on removing 11 million people from the U.S. He has previously promised to create a \"deportation force\"\u00a0to achieve that\u00a0and has also praised \"Operation Wetback,\"\u00a0an effort\u00a0by the government under Dwight Eisenhower to deport undocumented immigrants in the 1950s.\n\u201cPresident Obama has mass deported vast numbers of people -- the most ever, and it\u2019s never reported. I think people are going to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,\u201d he told Bloomberg. Asked whether he would issue \"mass deportations,\" Trump said \" \u201cno, I would not call it mass deportations.\u201d\nThe Muslim ban has been a central pillar of Trump's campaign for president. Given his penchant for saying virtually anything with little regard for the facts or previous statements, it's unclear whether he will stick by what he said on Saturday.\nEditor\u2019s\u00a0note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Appears To Shift On Muslim Ban"}
