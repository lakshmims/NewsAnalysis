And either one is unacceptable.\"\nTrump spent years questioning Obama's birthplace prior to running for president. So while Monday's statement may be jarring, it's not altogether surprising.\nThe business mogul is rather expert at making such coy, suggestive remarks -- he made similar ones after last year's San Bernardino shooting. And usually, his accusations are just vague enough that he can later insist he wasn't actually implying the most nefarious interpretation. Still, many observers on Monday morning noticed Trump's insinuation.\u00a0Beyond the suggestion that Obama is collaborating with ISIS, Trump called on the president to resign for refusing to utter the words \"radical Islam.\" He also continued to insist that the United States must temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country -- but added an even more frightening wrinkle by saying that many Muslims already in America \"are worse than\" Omar Mateen, the Orlando shooter. \n\"We're allowing people to come into our country that are no different than this maniac,\" said Trump. \"I don't know how many people are going to end up dying from this.\"\nAs for his prescription for dealing with the problem, Trump offered little beyond the usual tough-sounding bromides. \"I'm calling for strength, I'm calling for intelligence. We need strong surveillance,\" he said. Later, he added:\u00a0\n\n\n\"We have to be very strong in terms of looking at the mosques\"\n\n\n\"We have to really increase the bombing\"\n\n\n\"We have to knock out their internet capability\"\n\n\n\"We have to be furious for a short period of time and we're not doing it.\"\u00a0\n\n\nTrump concluded by congratulating himself and implying, once more, that Obama has some other motive.\u00a0\n\"I'm getting thousands of letters and tweets that I was right about the whole situation,\" Trump said of his prowess in predicting terrorist attacks. \"I don't want congratulations. What I want them to do is be tough and vigilant, our government. We are led by a man who is either not tough, not smart, or he has something else in mind. And the something else in mind, people can't believe it.\"\u00a0\nEditor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\n\u00a0", "title": "Donald Trump Suggests Obama May Be Sympathetic To Islamic Terrorism"}
