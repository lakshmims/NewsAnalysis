Such a big deal that the city is letting people skip out on court to attend the Cleveland Cavaliers' championship parade on Wednesday.\nJudge Ronald B. Adrine, presiding judge of the Cleveland Municipal Court\u2019s general division, said in a release on Tuesday\u00a0that people with hearings scheduled simultaneously with the Wednesday parade should just skip all that official business and go party without fear of punishment.\n\"The Cleveland Municipal Court\u2019s General Division will be open [Wednesday]\u00a0morning, as court dockets are scheduled to take place during these hours and service to the public is our primary obligation,\" he said. \"However, due to the special nature of tomorrow\u2019s events, those individuals with scheduled hearings who fail to appear will have their case continued automatically, without being subject to an arrest warrant or incurring additional cost.\"\nThe statement came the same day that Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson signed a very official-looking proclamation\u00a0declaring June 22, 2016, the date of the Championship Parade, a local holiday.\u00a0\"The strength and determination displayed throughout the season, post-season and championship game are truly the embodiment of our city and its people,\" the proclamation reads.\u00a0\nIf all of that's not the most Cleveland thing you've ever heard, we don't know what to tell you.\u00a0", "title": "Cleveland Is Letting People Skip Court For The Cavs' Championship Parade"}
