Billions of plastic cups are entering the landfill every year. If Loliware replaces even a small percentage, that would have far-reaching impact.\"Plastics are a major problem: An estimated\u00a08 million tons of plastics leak into the ocean each year, meaning the oceans may contain more plastic than fish by 2050.\nLoliware cups avoid this waste issue by being compostable,\u00a0degrading into soil within 60 days, according to Food & Wine. If you decide to be a litterbug and throw the cup outside, it will still quickly break down, according to Fast Company. \n\"If it happens to end up in a stream or a waterway where it's not supposed to, it's going to break down just like a banana peel would if it ends up in a stream,\" co-founder Leigh Ann Tucker told Fast Company. \"That is a big step up from other corn-based bioplastics that are actually still a huge issue in waterways.\"\nThe cups are made from seaweed and organic sweeteners, so they\u2019re entirely edible, according to the website. They're available in a variety of flavors, from Citrus to Cherry to Matcha Green Tea, so you can pair them with your drink of choice -- and according to Yahoo, they taste like \u201cartisan Fruit Roll Up.\u201d The founders first came up with the idea for the cups in 2010, when they entered a competition for Jell-O that asked contestants to use gelatin to create original -- and edible -- designs, reports Yahoo. After launching a modest $10,000 Kickstarter campaign in 2011, they finally hit it big with a $600,000 investment from Shark Tank in 2015, according to Sustainable Brands.\nTheir goal for the future is to to expand to other types of edible tableware, according to their website, from different cups to straws to edible water bottles.\nLoliware is not the only edible cup-game in town: A recent cookie-cup trend has Instagram users worldwide salivating, serving\u00a0coffee or milk\u00a0in cookie dough cups.\u00a0\nAt a price of $15.99 for a pack of four Loliware cups, a biodegr(edible)\u00a0cocktail party doesn't come cheap. But if you want to keep your fourth of July celebrations eco-friendly, their red and white cups may be the way to go. \nH/T Fast Company.
