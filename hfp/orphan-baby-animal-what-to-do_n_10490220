But that baby bird \u2014 or squirrel, or rabbit \u2014 really\u00a0looks like it needs help, you think to yourself. What do you do?\n\u201cMany of the babies \u2018rescued\u2019 every year did not need rescuing to begin with,\u201d Heather Tuttle, manager at\u00a0Castalia, Ohio, wildlife rehabilitation center Back to the Wild told The Huffington Post in an email.\nThe nonprofit wrote on Facebook\u00a0Tuesday that concerned members of the public have already brought the group \u201ctons\u201d of baby rabbits and birds that were in fact not orphaned, and did not need help. That\u2019s why the group posted this handy flowchart, explaining the steps people should take if they encounter a young bird, rabbit, skunk or squirrel.View a larger version of the chart here.\nDeer aren't on the chart, but Tuttle noted they're another animal people often mistake for orphans. Mother deer leave their fawns for hours at a time to forage for food, and a fawn\u2019s instinct is simply to freeze in place \u2014 so people often think there\u2019s something wrong when the deer doesn\u2019t run away. However, \u00a0a mother deer sometimes leaves her offspring in a dangerous place like underneath a truck, and in those cases the best course of action is to try and keep the area clear until the doe returns to her offspring.\nWhen people erroneously bring in baby animals, the group tries its best to reunite them with their mothers, Tuttle said, but that\u2019s not always possible. And even the best wildlife rehabber can never be as good as the animal\u2019s real mother.\u00a0\n\u201cIn the wild they learn to avoid predators, they are able to hone their instincts, and have real life experience foraging, hunting, and surviving,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cIn captivity, we can simulate these things but it just isn't the same.\u201d\nAnd what\u2019s up with the no-food-or-water mandate on that chart? Feeding baby animals is just another way people often wind up causing damage when they think they\u2019re helping.\n\u201cAs tempting as it is to feed baby animals, doing so can lead to their demise,\u201d Tuttle said. \u201cThere is so much bad information on the internet for how to care for squirrels, bunnies, birds, and more. We get many babies in that are sickly and malformed because they've spent the last several weeks being fed the wrong diet.\u201d\nAnd even just water can be fatal. Birds are especially susceptible to aspirating \u2014 meaning taking water into their lungs \u2014 though this can also happen to mammals if they\u2019re given water too quickly. And if an animal has a head injury or internal damage, giving it food or water can make things worse.\nThe bottom line is that unless an animal is in immediate danger, you should always call an expert for advice before taking any action. And if you have no idea who the local wildlife rehabilitator might be, Tuttle suggested checking your state's Department of Natural Resources (or a similar agency) website, which will usually include a list or database.\u00a0And the Humane Society of the United States notes that if you can't get in touch with a wildlife rehabber directly, you should try contacting a veterinarian, animal control agency, nature center or state wildlife agency for help.", "title": "Here's How To Tell If That 'Orphaned' Baby Animal Really Needs Your Help"}
