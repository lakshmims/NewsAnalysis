The third original member of TLC, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, died in a car crash in 2002.\u00a0Not one to be outdone (or labeled a \"scrub\"), Saldana's \"Star Trek\" co-star Zachary Quinto wowed the crowd with a hilarious/insane/perfect rendition of Missy Elliott's \"Get Ur Freak On.\"\u00a0\nWearing a bedazzled jean outfit, painted nails,\u00a0silver jewels and a brilliant shade of red lipstick, Quinto was puttin' it down. LL Cool J literally could not keep his cool, either:\u00a0Missy obviously approved of the performance, as she retweeted\u00a0a clip of Quinto performing.\u00a0Watch their full performances below.Tune into \"Lip Sync Battle\" Thursdays at 10 p.m. ET on Spike.\u00a0", "title": "Zoe Saldana Brings Out TLC For Incredible \u2018No Scrubs\u2019 Performance On \u2018Lip Sync Battle\u2019"}
