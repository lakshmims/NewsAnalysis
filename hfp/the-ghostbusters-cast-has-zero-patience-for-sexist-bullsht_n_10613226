The onslaught of sexist reactions to the trailer, the film and the cast has been exhausting since the movie began promotion almost a year ago.\u00a0\nWiig, Jones, McCarthy and McKinnon ain't got\u00a0no time for the haters, though. The cast told Itzkoff:\n\nJones:\u00a0To me, the people who are crying about, \u201cThis is ruining my childhood,\u201d this movie is not for them anyway.\nWiig:\u00a0They need to probably go to therapy.\nMcCarthy:\u00a0I think their childhood was pretty much ruined already. If this broke it, it was pretty fragile to begin with. It is good to remember, it is a tiny, tiny fraction that screams. Normal, healthy people don\u2019t stand outside, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re ruining my childhood!\u201d There\u2019s one nut on every corner in every city that does it. But so what? The other 300,000 people in a town aren\u2019t doing that.\n\nMcCarthy added that while they were filming she heard more about the young girls who were excited about the film than the sexist backlash. \"When we were shooting, Paul would bring in pictures of young girls dressing up, and they had made their own proton packs and jumpsuits, and I thought, that\u2019s really cool,\" she said. \"I was more aware of that stuff.\"\nJones said she was surprised by the backlash \"because women have been killing it for years,\" adding, \"It\u2019s the same thing, when you go to a comedy club. [announcer\u2019s voice] 'Are you guys ready for a woman?' Are you ready for a unicorn?\u00a0Why is being a woman so surprising? There are two sexes. A man and a woman. So, if it\u2019s not a man in a movie, what else was it going to be?\"\nWe are ready for four unicorns, and they go by the names of Melissa, Kristen, Leslie and Kate.\u00a0\nHead over to The New York Times to read the full interview.\u00a0\nWatch the trailer for the new \"Ghostbusters\" film below.\u00a0", "title": "The 'Ghostbusters' Cast Has Zero Patience For Sexist Bullsh*t"}
