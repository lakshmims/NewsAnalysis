The image\u00a0was featured in The New Yorker\u00a0as part of a series on members of the U.S. military called \"Service.\"\nPlaton recalls Powell explaining how that photo series inspired him\u00a0to announce\u00a0-- just 16 days before the 2008 election -- that he would be endorsing Obama because of anti-Muslim sentiments in the Republican Party. Hear the story behind the photograph and why its message is still relevant as we approach the 2016 election in the video above.\nThis video was produced by Will Tooke and edited by Alfred Marroquin.", "title": "How One Photograph Prompted Colin Powell To Support Obama"}
