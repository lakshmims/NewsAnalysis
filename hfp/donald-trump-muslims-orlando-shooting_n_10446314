He even expanded the idea to include potential visitors from any nation or place that he (as president) would deem a threat.\nHe insinuated that both President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were ignorant, weak-willed or complicit \u2013 or all three \u2013 in what he termed a total breakdown of U.S. immigration security.\nAnd like an orange-haired knight of the 12th century, he in effect vowed to lead a crusade -- not to capture Old Jerusalem from the infidels, but to protect a New Jerusalem (America) from being overrun by what he repeatedly (at least 18 times) called \u201cradical Islam\u201d or \u201cIslamic terrorists.\u201d\nIt was surely the most virulent attack on another culture and faith in American politics in decades. And it echoed vitriol of past centuries unleashed against Catholics,\u00a0Jews, African-Americans and others once deemed to be outsiders.\nNow many may hope that Trump\u2019s screed \u2013 delivered in Manchester, New Hampshire, at Saint Anselm College, an institution named in honor of a paragon of Christian rationalism \u2013 was a wild shot that landed harmlessly in the New England woods.\nIt was anything but. With the sure touch of a safecracker, Trump on Monday sought to bring forth the deep insecurities of an American electorate that is not only frightened about terrorism but more generally alarmed that the America they thought they knew is disappearing in the latest waves of immigration, networks of new technologies, and the rising power of distant cultures.Trump, who burst onto the political stage a few years ago insinuating that Obama was a foreign-born Muslim agent, has now expanded that charge to include 1.6 billion Muslims around the world and other people from other places he deems dangerous.\u00a0Chinese businessmen, Mexican drug dealers, NATO bureaucrats \u2013 they are all threats,\u00a0but the leading edge of fear is Muslim immigration in Trump\u2019s worldview.\nIt is a view shared by more voters than perhaps Democrats and media elites appreciate. A poll in March showed that half of all voters agreed with Trump\u2019s call for a \u201ctemporary\u201d ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S.\nAfter Orlando, that number is sure to grow \u2013 especially if Trump has anything to do with it.\nEditor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\nHow to help the Orlando shooting victims:", "title": "Donald Trump Has A Message For The World: Stay The Hell Out"}
