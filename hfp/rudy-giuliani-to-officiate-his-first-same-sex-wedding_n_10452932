The groom-to-be told HuffPost that Giuliani promised to perform the rites for his big day,\u00a0correctly predicting that the court would legalize same-sex marriage.\u00a0\n\"He gave me a big hug,\"\u00a0Segal said to HuffPost.Now after officiating what Giuliani estimated to be 200 straight ceremonies in a Washington Post article, Giuliani is about to hitch Segal, 52, who worked with Giuliani at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani (now just Bracewell), and Hatch, a 33-year-old interior designer.\nThe Republican politician, once a proponent of civil unions for same-sex couples, said it was time for a change. \"My views have evolved on this issue, like so many other people\u2019s,\" Giuliani told the Post. \"For a long time, my religious background gave me a resistance to the idea of marriage rights, but as I looked at it, I came to realize that in so many cases the relationships were \u2026 stronger and better than heterosexual marriages.\"\nIn 2011, Giuliani reportedly reneged on a pledge to perform marriage vows for gay friends who had let Giuliani crash on their couch when the former mayor was going through a divorce in 2001.\nAs for Saturday's nuptials, Giuliani told the Washington Post, \"I\u2019m glad our society has come to this point.\"", "title": "Rudy Giuliani To Officiate His First Same-Sex Wedding"}
