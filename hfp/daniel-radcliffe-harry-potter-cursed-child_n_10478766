Daniel Radcliffe\u00a0is spilling all the tea.\u00a0\nRadcliffe, who played Harry Potter for the better part of a decade, naturally has some complicated feelings toward the franchise's new play, \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.\"\u00a0That being said, we always expected him to at least take in a show for curiosity's sake.\u00a0\nBut when Radcliffe visited \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on Tuesday, he made a startling admission: he has no plans to see \"Cursed Child\" anytime soon.\u00a0\"I feel like I want to see the show. I am genuinely intrigued and I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s fantastic. But I just feel sitting in an audience of what will, for most of the near future, be very enthusiastic 'Harry Potter' fans might be like not a relaxing way to see a show,\u201d Radcliffe admitted, according to Express.\u00a0\nThis reveal is probably to the benefit of \"Harry Potter\" die-hards, who'd most likely spontaneously combust out of excitement over the prospect of sitting next to Radcliffe at the show.\u00a0\nHowever, the English actor did extend his warmest wishes to the new Harry, Jamie Parker, whom he hopes will lighten his \"Harry Potter\" fan load.\u00a0\n\"[He's] a wonderful actor and I'm very very happy to see him playing me.\" Radcliffe said. \"He can do all the Harry questions now.\u201dThe first part of the production, which began previews earlier this month, has already received rave reviews from critics and fans alike. The official premiere isn't scheduled until June 30, but the play's script will be published as book on July 31, aka Harry's birthday.\u00a0", "title": "Daniel Radcliffe Has A Very Good Reason For Not Wanting To See 'Harry Potter And The Cursed Child'"}
