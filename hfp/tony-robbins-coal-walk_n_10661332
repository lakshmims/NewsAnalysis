The others were treated and released at the scene. It was unclear how many participated in the coal walk.\nThe three-day seminar is intended to help people \"break through any limit\" and improve their quality of life, according to a description posted on Robbins' website.\nRepresentatives for Robbins, who is a popular motivational speaker, personal finance adviser and bestselling author, were not immediately available for comment.\nAccording to media reports, 21 out of 6,000 people who walked on hot coals at a Robbins event in 2012 in California were treated for burns.\nMost people avoid burns because coals are not efficient conductors of heat, but standing too long in one spot and other factors can increase the risk. In the 2012 incident, there was speculation that the large number of people participating caused the lines of firewalkers to slow down, raising chances of burns.\n(Additional reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "title": "Tony Robbins Hot-Coal Walk Injures Dozens In Dallas"}
