And we ought to step back and reassess why, and what we can do about it.\"Top Democrats have taken steps in the last week to begin rallying behind Clinton and ease\u00a0Sanders out of the race without alienating his supporters.\nPresident Barack Obama endorsed Clinton on Thursday, hours after meeting with Sanders at the White House. Clinton also secured the endorsement of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a leader of the party's progressive wing.\nClinton already has turned her attention on the campaign trail to the race with Trump, rejecting the New York businessman's renewed calls for a ban of the entry of foreign-born Muslims into the United States after the mass shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, by an American man who claimed allegiance with Islamic State militants.\n\"I have clearly said that we faced terrorist enemies who use a perverted version of Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them, and we will,\" Clinton said in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday. \"But I will not demonize and declare war on an entire religion.\"\n\u00a0\n(Additional reporting by Alana Wise, Amanda Becker and James Oliphant; Editing by Leslie Adler and Nick Macfie)", "title": "Hillary Clinton Wins Washington D.C.
