The battle over gay marriage cost Florida taxpayers almost $500,000, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\"You've basically gone after people, said in court that gay people, simply by fighting for marriage equality, were trying to do harm to the people of Florida,\" Cooper told her. \"Do you really think you're a champion of the gay community?\"\nBondi argued her push against gay marriage was in defense of an amendment adopted by Florida voters in 2008 that banned same-sex marriages.\n\"I've never said I don't like gay people, that's ridiculous,\" Bondi told Cooper.\nThe two debated over Bondi's fight against gay marriage, with Cooper asking Bondi if there's a \"sick irony\" to her assistance to the loved ones of the Orlando shooting victims.\nWatch the exchange above.\u00a0", "title": "Anderson Cooper Grills Woman Who Led Charge Against Gay Marriage In Florida"}
