The 51-year-old, already widely known for his social activism, hasn't made negative comments about Trump and instead devotes resources to supporting his opponent.\u00a0Benioff was supporting Clinton long before it was clear that Trump would emerge as the presumptive Republican nominee, he pointed out. He hosted a fundraiser at his home in San Francisco earlier this year that he said netted $500,000 and has donated $2,700 to her campaign.\n\u201cI\u2019m not supporting her because I\u2019m against Trump,\u201d he added, noting that he believes deeply in Clinton\u2019s positions. He first came out in support of the candidate in March during an interview on CNN.\n\u201cShe supports equality for all, including gender equality and pay, which is important to me,\u201d Benioff told HuffPost. \u201cShe supports LGBT equality, which is important to my employees. I think she has the right economic policies and she is the most experienced candidate for the job. She\u2019s more likely to do the right thing than anybody else.\u201d\nBenioff earned widespread recognition last year after publicly announcing there was a gender pay gap at his software company and that he would fix it. He then revealed he\u2019d spent $3 million giving out raises to employees to ensure fair pay.\nHe\u2019s since become a corporate leader on gender pay equity and a number of companies have followed suit, announcing their own pay audits. In January, he urged other chief executives to stop turning \u201ca blind eye to what\u2019s happening in their own corporations\u201d during a conference call organized by the White House.\nThe chief executive also led a successful campaign to beat back several state laws that sought to legalize discrimination against LGBT people, earning wide acclaim and a profile in The Wall Street Journal, which credited him with kicking off a \u201cnew era of corporate social activism.\u201d \nThough the political activism that puts him in line with the Clinton campaign took shape over the last two years, he has long partnered with the Clinton Foundation on other philanthropic endeavors. In 2014, he donated $3.5 million to Too Small To Fail, an early childhood education campaign founded in part by the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. The donation fostered a literacy program at the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital Oakland that helps low-income mothers teach their children to speak, read and sing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a huge success story,\u201d Benioff said of the joint venture with Clinton\u2019s charitable organization. \u201cShe realizes that a child\u2019s health and education and fundamental ability to be a success starts prenatally.\u201d\nNot all his fellow CEOs are taking the speak-no-evil route when it comes to Trump. On Wednesday, venture capitalist Chris Sacca, an early Twitter investor, and billionaire Marc Cuban took part in some Trump bashing on Twitter.And earlier this week Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said Trump was on the wrong side of history when it comes to his policies on immigration.\nDon\u2019t expect Benioff to follow suit. \n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not [worried about Trump],\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way Donald Trump will be president.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "CEO Explains How To Defeat Donald Trump Without Stooping To His Level"}
