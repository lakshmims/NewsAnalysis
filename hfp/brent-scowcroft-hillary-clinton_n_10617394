She understands that our leadership and engagement beyond our borders makes the world, and therefore the United States more secure and prosperous,\" Scowcroft, who served as the National Security Adviser to presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, said in a statement. \"She appreciates that it is essential to maintain our strong military advantage, but that force must be used as a last resort.\"\nHe also praised Clinton's judgement -- something that has been repeatedly questioned by her presidential rivals.\n\"The presidency requires the judgement and the knowledge to make tough calls under pressure. As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton helped broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, assembled a global coalition to impose a sanctions regime on Iran, and played a crucial role in persuading Iran to accept limits on its nuclear program.\"\nScowcroft's endorsement follows that of Richard Armitage, a former deputy secretary of state to George W. Bush, who told Politico that Trump \"doesn\u2019t appear to be a Republican.\" A number of other Republicans have also said that they would vote for Clinton over Trump.", "title": "Former National Security Adviser To Two GOP Presidents Endorses Hillary Clinton"}
