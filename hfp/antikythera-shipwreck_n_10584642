Dolphins were defensive weapons that were dropped from the ship's yard -- a spar on the mast -- onto the deck of an attacking ship, such as a pirate vessel.\u00a0The scientists used an autonomous robot to map a 10,500-square-meter (2.6 acres) area of sea floor at a depth of 170 feet, then sent divers down to inspect the site, according to a WHOI news release.\u00a0\nNew lab techniques allowed the team to extract DNA from ceramic jars to determine what food, drinks and medicines were once inside, and test the isotopes of lead objects to determine where they came from.\u00a0\n\"Our new technologies extend capabilities for marine science,\" marine archaeologist Brendan Foley said in a WHOI news release. \"Every new dive on the Antikythera shipwreck delivers gifts from the ancient past. The wreck offers touchstones to the full range of the human experience: from religion, music, and art, to travel, trade and even warfare.\"\nSome objects were brought to the surface while others were left on the sea floor.The shipwreck, discovered in 1900 by sponge divers, was most known for the Antikythera Mechanism,\u00a0an ancient device that in some ways may have been the world's first computer.\u00a0The clock-like gadget with interlocking gears was believed to have been used to help predict eclipses and the positions of celestial bodies.\u00a0\nOver the years, archaeologists have also recovered marble statues and thousands of other artifacts. At least 300 pieces were pulled from the wreck during a 1976 expedition by legendary underwater explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.\u00a0\n\"In 27 days and despite frequent bad weather, they recovered hundreds of objects: ceramic vessels, components of marble statues, bronze statuettes, bronze coins, gold jewelry and gemstones, fine glassware and human skeletal remains,\" WHOI wrote about the Cousteau expedition.\u00a0\nThere might be more discoveries to come. The researchers said they also found the wreck of a second ancient cargo ship nearby.\u00a0", "title": "2,000-Year-Old Antikythera Shipwreck Famous For 'Ancient Computer' Yields New Treasures"}
