(The term lidar is an acronym for Light Detection And Ranging).\n\u201cThe lidar quite suddenly revealed an entire cityscape there with astonishing complexity,\u201d Evans told Agence France-Presse. \u201cIt turned out we\u2019d been walking and flying right over the top of this stuff for ten years and not even noticing it because of the vegetation.\u201dToday's surviving temples from the Khmer Empire were once surrounded by many other structures made of wood and thatch, material that allowed the buildings to easily rot away. But lasers attached to helicopters were able to locate more durable stone structures and elaborately placed earth mounds, which are being called \"dome fields,\" according to Evans' report in the Journal of Archaeological Science.\nEven without breaking ground, scientists are calling it a mammoth of a find.\n\u201cThis urban and rural landscape, linked by road and canal networks, now seems to have constituted the largest empire on earth in the 12th century,\u201d Peter Sharrock of London University\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies, told the Guardian.But it's not just the ruins' size that's rewriting history. As Evans notes, the findings also appear to shatter previous beliefs that the Angkorian people eventually abandoned the cities for ones in the south.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an idea that somehow the Thais invaded and everyone fled down south,\" Evans told the Guardian. \"That didn\u2019t happen; there are no cities [revealed by the aerial survey] that they fled to. It calls into question the whole notion of an Angkorian collapse.\u201d\nToday, the region's stone temple ruins are revered as\u00a0the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia by the United Nations' Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\u00a0The temples, which include the Temple of Angkor Wat and the Bayon Temple at Angkor Thom, make up not only the largest operating archaeological site in the world but one of the most popular tourist destinations.\nUnfortunately, that kind of attention isn't always good.\n\"Tourism represents an enormous economic potential but it can also generate irreparable destructions of the tangible as well as intangible cultural heritage,\" UNESCO states on its website.\nThe researchers' report in the Journal of Archaeological Science credited human conflict and underdevelopment in present-day Cambodia with preserving much of the region's archaeological topography. Archaeological landscapes beyond Cambodia's borders have otherwise been destroyed through agricultural and urban developments over the last hundred years, the report states.\nFortunately for the latest discoveries, Evans believes it's highly unlikely that tourists will be flocking to these newly uncovered sites, which he described to The Associated Press as \"mounds in the ground.\"", "title": "Ancient Cities Discovered Beneath Jungle Surrounding Angkor Wat Temples"}
