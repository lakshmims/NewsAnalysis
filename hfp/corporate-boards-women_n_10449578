We\u2019re poised to possibly elect a woman president, yet the boards of directors of too many companies in corporate America look like this:This is a photo of the men who sit on the board of Discovery Communications.\nThe media firm, which holds a variety of cable networks including Discovery, TLC, and Animal Planet and proudly promotes its diversity and inclusion policy on its corporate webpage, is hardly the only major public company with an all-male board.\u00a0\nNearly 3 percent of S&P 500 firms have no women on their boards,\u00a0according to a report released Tuesday by the nonprofit Catalyst and consulting firm EY. Twenty-four percent of S&P 500 boards have only one essentially token woman. Put more simply, about a third of the boards of the country\u2019s biggest and most influential businesses are nearly devoid of women at the top.\u00a0\nThe remaining boardrooms are overwhelmingly male.\u00a0Men held 80 percent of the board seats on S&P 500 companies last year, according to the report. That number is virtually unchanged from the previous year and isn't likely to budge any time soon.\n\u201cThis is not an acceptable situation,\u201d Jan Combopiano, senior vice president of research at Catalyst, told The Huffington Post. \u201cWe want to live in a world where we can see equality of opportunity is actually real.\u201d\nThat the largest companies in the world have majority male directors\u00a0-- the board oversees a company\u2019s CEO and ensures it's operating in the best interests of shareholders -- does a disservice not only to those businesses, which have a diverse range of customers and employees, but also to basic notions of fairness and equality.\nThere\u2019s a notion many have that, in business,\u00a0the best, most talented people are the ones who get ahead. Judging by my Twitter feed when I write about boardroom equality, some argue that more men ascend to the boardroom simply because there aren\u2019t enough qualified women. \nThat\u2019s misguided, Combopiano said.\n\u201cPeople think meritocracy exists, but they don\u2019t talk about privilege,\u201d she said, adding that boards are very tight-knit, and getting an appointment is mainly all about \u201cwho you know.\u201d\nThe typically older men with the board seats seem to mostly know other men, with whom they've worked and socialized for their entire careers. These networks simply don\u2019t include enough white women, women of color or men of color.\n\u201cIn [older men\u2019s] professional life they didn\u2019t come across a lot of women \u2014 that either reported to them or they met at business school,\u201d Julie Hembrock Daum, a recruiter at executive search firm Spencer Stuart, told HuffPost\u00a0earlier this year. \u201cThey really don\u2019t know them.\u201d\nUnless boards act deliberately to fill seats with women, it\u2019s not going to happen. Combopiano pointed to Canadian bank BMO, which purposefully alternates open board seats with men and women.\nCatalyst offers other advice to firms interested in diversity. The group suggests requiring boards to consider multiple female candidates for open positions, imposing term limits on directors so seats turn over more quickly, sponsoring more women for their first board seats and even adding another seat for a woman.\nDiscovery Communications, which currently has no women or people of color on its board, told HuffPost in an emailed statement that it is working on it. \"We are engaged in a robust process to identify diverse board candidates and we continue to develop a slate of diverse candidates that will best meet our board's needs,\" the statement said. \"We are very committed to a diverse workforce ... and that also includes the board of directors.\"\nThere's a strongly held belief at most companies that the best candidates for board seats are current or former CEOs. Since only 4 percent CEOs on the S&P 500 are women, that leaves companies with a very small candidate pool from which to choose.\nHowever, CEOs are not the only qualified people out there, according to Combopiano and other recruiters who\u2019ve spoken with HuffPost. \nInstead of simply bringing on chief executives, boards are now going after seasoned professionals who have a certain skill set, Combopiano said.\nSo now some seek out chief financial officers with deep finance backgrounds, for example, or those with tech experience. Sheryl Sandberg, for example, has never run a company, but the Facebook chief operating officer holds seats on her company's board and on Disney\u2019s board.\nProgress is also slow because very few board seats open up in any given year. In 2016, only 8 percent of seats on the S&P 500 were vacant, according to a different survey from\u00a0Spencer Stuart.\u00a0\nAccording to the Catalyst report, in 2015, about 30 percent of those vacancies went to women.\nAt this rate we won\u2019t see parity for a long, long time. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be longer than my lifetime and your lifetime. And it might be longer than your children\u2019s lifetimes,\u201d Combopiano said. The only way things will move faster is if companies take deliberate action to make changes, she said.\n\u201cInertia is a powerful force.\u201d\u00a0 ", "title": "This Photo Tells You Everything You Need To Know About Corporate Boardrooms"}
