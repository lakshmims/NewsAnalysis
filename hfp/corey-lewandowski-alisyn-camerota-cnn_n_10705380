He disputed that he is persona non grata among CNN's staff because of his infamously\u00a0combative attitude toward reporters up until he was fired as Trump's campaign manager on June 20.\"I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard about some of the reaction,\" Camerota said,\u00a0alluding to reports that CNN staff have criticized Lewandowski's hiring. \"It turns out not everybody is a fan of the decision and I think that the crux of the criticism is that you\u2019ve never seemed to be a big fan of the press or to have much respect for the press. Why did you have such strained relations during your time there at the Trump campaign with the press.\"\nDespite evidence to the contrary, including allegations that he battered a reporter by grabbing her arm, Lewandowski insisted that he worked well with journalists. (The battery charge was later dropped.)\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think what you have is if you look at the individuals i worked closely with on a day-to-day basis, we had great relationships,\" Lewandowski said. \"I have great relationships the media. Those individuals who are embeds get to know me the best. The individuals who I spoke to on a regular basis, the individuals who are on your set here today.\"\nLewandowski upped the rhetoric about his feelings toward the news media after Camerota questioned him about his threat to blacklist a CNN reporter who'd left an area designated for journalists at a Trump event in November.\u00a0\n\"Look, I love everybody ... I love you, right?\" he said to Camerota.\nPage Six reported on Friday that Lewandowski's hiring nearly provoked a revolt and that he's especially unpopular with female reporters and producers.\u00a0\nWhen Brian Stelter, CNN's media correspondent, did a follow-up story he concluded that Lewandowski's hiring produced \"discomfort\" around the newsroom.\n\"The bottom line is I have a great relationship with the press,\" Lewandowski said to Camerota. \"I have a lot of friends at all the networks and that\u2019s the truth.\"\n\"I\u2019ve been so lucky to interact with the press as much as I have,\" he continued. \"It doesn\u2019t mean I always agree. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m always going to agree because I\u2019m a person who\u2019s going to call it the way I see it and if I think something\u2019s out of line I\u2019m going to tell people that.\"", "title": "Corey Lewandowski Gets Grilled By New CNN Colleague"}
