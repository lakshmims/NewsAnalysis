Authorities said the driver, Charles Pickett Jr., was caught trying to escape on foot after the front end of his truck was demolished. Police in three jurisdictions\u00a0had been searching for his vehicle\u00a0after receiving multiple reports that he was driving erratically.\nPickett, 50, was charged last week with\u00a0five counts of second-degree murder and four counts of reckless driving causing serious body impairment.\u00a0Authorities haven't disclosed whether he was impaired\u00a0at the time and haven't speculated on the cause of the crash.\nThe cyclists were part of a group called the \u201cChain Gang\u201d\u00a0and rode together regularly, according to The Associated Press. Those killed were Debra Ann Bradley, 53; Melissa Ann Fevig-Hughes, 42; Fred Anton \u201cTony\u201d Nelson, 73; Lorenz John \u201cLarry\u201d Paulik, 74; and Suzanne Joan Sippel, 56. Two men and two women were hospitalized.\n\u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018Oh no, not again.\u2019 This happens all too often throughout the state and the country,\u201d said Jim Ferner, founder and director of the Complete Streets Coalition of Kalamazoo. \u201cWe\u2019ve got \u2026 a cultural paradigm of \u2018drive or die\u2019 in this state.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Dangers Of Rural Roads\u00a0\nNorth Westnedge Avenue is a rural and hilly two-lane road. Just beyond the crash site, the speed limit increases from 35 mph to 50 mph. A neighbor told the Detroit Free Press that\u00a0drivers often speed up\u00a0there, anticipating the higher speed zone.\nThe shoulders are \u201cpretty much non-existent,\u201d said Ferner, who knows several other bikers who have been hit on the same road.The majority of bike crashes occur on urban streets, where cyclists compete with a dense melange of cars, taxis, buses, trucks and pedestrians. Recreational cyclists often seek to ride outside those urban confines on suburban or rural roads with light traffic and scenic beauty.\nBut the features that make those roads attractive can also make them deadly.\u00a0Roads like Westnedge are\u00a0particularly dangerous for cyclists, according to Bill Schultheiss, a principal engineer with the Toole Design Group who works on improving street design for cyclists and pedestrians in projects around the country. While motorists in cities are more accustomed to sharing the street with cyclists and pedestrians, drivers on rural roads don't always have the same awareness.\n\u201cTwo-lane rural roads have higher fatality rates for cyclists than even a lot of urban streets, because of the higher speeds,\u201d Schultheiss said. \u201cThe expectation on those, from most drivers, is that they have the whole road to themselves.\u201d\nBike Advocates Face An Uphill Battle\nThere's no indication that a different street design would have prevented the Kalamazoo crash. But in general,\u00a0Schultheiss said, infrastructure changes should be the primary method of reducing bike fatalities, rather than simply educating motorists or admonishing cyclists to be cautious.\u00a0\n\"Every newspaper article,\u00a0almost without fail, will tend to say, 'Was the bicyclist wearing a helmet?' anytime there's a crash. 'What color clothes were they wearing?'\"\u00a0Schultheiss said. \u201cThat\u2019s victim-blaming.\u201d\u00a0\nBoth Schultheiss and Ferner said widening the shoulders on Westnedge to give bikers a separate lane should be the first priority to increase safety.\nLike many cities, downtown Kalamazoo is expanding bike lanes, and the region has a network of trails. But advocates have struggled to rally support for safer bike infrastructure on county roads, according to Ferner. The road commission, tasked with maintaining Westnedge and other county roads, has essentially done nothing to address cyclists\u2019 safety concerns, he said.\n\u201cWhen you start talking about bicycle facilities, especially the rural areas \u2026 you really get shouted down,\u201d Ferner said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\nJoanna Johnson, managing director of the Kalamazoo County Road Commission, said it wouldn't be prudent to comment before the crash investigation is complete, but said the commission was deeply saddened by the tragedy.\n\u201cOur mission is to provide safe and convenient roadways for every member of the public,\u201d Johnson wrote in an email. \u201cWe remain committed to that mission,\u00a0and are proud of our organization and stand with our community partners who share this objective.\u201d\nSchultheiss said he often hears from officials that they don\u2019t have the funding to improve roads for bikes and pedestrians, even as states spend hundreds of millions on major interstate highway projects focused on cars and trucks.\u201cWe have a lot of problems with our infrastructure design that can be corrected if we\u2019re willing to tackle the design issues and put some money toward fixing them,\u201d Schultheiss said.\n\u201cWe have the proof that this works,\" he added. \"Countries like the Netherlands and Sweden, where \u2026 they\u2019ve actually spent their money on infrastructure [for bicyclists and pedestrians].\"\nHow Communities Are Rallying For Cyclist Safety\nMany U.S. cities are following European examples and spending money to make their streets more bike-friendly and walkable. Last fall, Portland, Oregon, opened Tilikum Crossing, a bridge over the Willamette River that is closed to cars but open to bikers, pedestrians and public transit. New York City has added hundreds of miles of new bike lanes in the last decade and witnessed a major increase in bike ridership,\u00a0along with a\u00a0decrease in risk for cyclists.Nationwide, bike commuting jumped 60 percent between 2000 and 2012,\u00a0though it still accounts for less than 1 percent of all commuting trips. The increase has been greater in some bike-friendly cities -- over 7 percent of commuters in Portland, Oregon, are cyclists.\nIn the last several years, the U.S. Department of Transportation has begun to look more closely at alternative transit, stating in a 2010 policy brief that \"transportation agencies should\u00a0plan, fund, and implement improvements to their walking and bicycling networks.\"\nIn May, DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx told BikePortland.org that an\u00a0effective transportation system needs a mix of options.\u00a0\u201cIt includes the automobile, but it\u2019s not exclusive to the automobile,\u201d he said.\nThe promotion of cycling has led to economic and health benefits for many cities, but most rural areas have not made the same investments in infrastructure,\u00a0despite interest from local riders.\u00a0\nThere are some exceptions. Last year, Florida made it standard for all state roads to include wider bike lanes with a buffer from car traffic. Lanes will be added as roads are repaved or undergo construction.\u00a0 \u00a0\nResponding To Tragedy\nIn some cases, bike fatalities have motivated communities to make roads safer.\n\u201cWe accept a lot of deaths on our roadways. It\u2019s just normal,\u201d Schultheiss said. \u201cIt takes something really dramatic to open people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\nThe community response to the tragedy in Michigan was immediate. The day after the crash,\u00a0about 600 mourners gathered in Kalamazoo for a silent bike ride for the victims, and a donation fund was quickly set up to support their families.\nOn Tuesday, Lance Armstrong joined hundreds of bikers in Kalamazoo to \"finish the ride\" the Chain Gang cyclists started before the crash.\u00a0The crash has also drawn attention to ongoing safety issues. The National Transportation Safety Board, which does not usually address bike incidents, began investigating the Michigan crash last week. A bipartisan bill package introduced into the state Senate would impose harsher penalties on drivers who kill or injure cyclists or pedestrians.\n\u201cThis is going to cause us to double down on our efforts,\u201d Ferner said. \u201cWe want to make sure we\u2019ve done all we can do to get the local government and the state government to consider bicycles and pedestrians and get these streets safe for everybody.\u201d\nKate Abbey-Lambertz covers sustainable cities, housing and inequality.
