Those all have been battleground states in recent presidential elections and are part of an \"eight-figure\" ad buy, according to her campaign.\nOne ad highlights Clinton's work as first lady to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides funding to states to support families with children who are unable to afford health insurance but do not qualify for Medicaid benefits.\n\"That's the kind of leader she is, and the kind of president she'll be,\" the ad says.\nFor weeks, Clinton has mounted an aggressive general election campaign\u00a0against Trump, giving speeches and interviews questioning his qualifications to be president and warning voters that he is \"temperamentally unfit to be commander in chief.\"\nHer campaign unveiled a third ad earlier this week that focuses more overtly on Trump, depicting him as a divisive figure who could destroy the country.\n\"What kind of America do we want to be? Dangerously divided, or strongly united?\" Clinton says in the ad.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\u00a0", "title": "Hillary Clinton Launches General Election Ads In 8 Battleground States"}
