The United States has relied on an all-volunteer army since 1973, which Clinton said she continues to favor.\n\"I am on record as supporting the all-volunteer military, which I think at this time does serve our country well,\" she said.\u00a0\"And I am very committed to supporting and really lifting up the men and women in uniform and their families.\" \nBut requiring women to register for the draft has become a symbolic measure for many lawmakers, buttressing the argument that there is not an inherent gender component to one's ability to serve in the military.\n\nThe Senate voted 85 to 13 on Tuesday to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, which included the provision requiring women between the ages of 18 and 25 to sign up to serve their country. As HuffPost's Jennifer Bendery noted, it was a rare demonstration of bipartisan support for such a culturally significant milestone.\n\n\u201cI support it,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who served in the Air Force for years, told HuffPost last month. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to take half your population off the sidelines in case of a national emergency.\u201d\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) added that\u00a0\u201cit\u2019s just a matter of time\u201d until women are treated equally in the military.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Thinks Women Should Be Included In The Draft"}
