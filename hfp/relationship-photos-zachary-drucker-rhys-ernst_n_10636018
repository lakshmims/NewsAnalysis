The pleasure of abiding. The pleasure of insistence, persistence. The pleasure of obligation, the pleasure of dependency.\u201d\nThe book is an undulating ode to her relationship with the gender-fluid artist Harry Dodge. In writing about their courtship and marriage, Nelson embraces the freeing act of casting off gender norms, while also pledging allegiance to a committed relationship.\nShe\u2019s a fitting writer, then, to contribute to a book of photos and writing about a couple like any other -- a couple that leaves loves notes scrawled on napkins, snaps pics while eating watermelon, and hangs out on their beige couch -- except that neither person adheres to gender binaries and each is in the midst of undergoing a transition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s become something of a lazy commonplace that gender is best understood as a relation we have with ourselves, whereas sexuality is essentially relational,\u201d Nelson writes in Relationship, which chronicles the offhanded photos taken by a trans/trans couple, artists Zackary Drucker and Rhys Ernst, in the throes of love.\nThe photos capture Drucker and Ernst lounging on wrinkly sheets, gripping peeled oranges on stoops, slouching by pools aside full ashtrays. Each image is a lo-fi slice of life. To flip through the book\u2019s images is to scroll through a couple\u2019s iPhone photos, scanning through the posed, the casual, and the intimate.\nRhys explains the project in the books introduction, writing, \u201cHad we met at another point in our lives, we might not have been so driven to document ourselves. But we were in the unflattering throes of yet another puberty ... each learning from the other's gender history.\"\nCollectively, the images project the idea that gender is only a performance insofar as any relationship is. There are moments of pure individuality, and moments where your private self curls up against someone else\u2019s private self, giving each other shape.\nSee images from Relationship, published by Prestel, below:", "title": "In 'Relationship,' A Trans/Trans Couple Collected Intimate Photos Of Life Together"}
