At the time the sight of women displaying their bodies prompted giggles, embarrassment and the odd sneer of derision from me and my school-age friends.

It was an unspoken rule that you had to undress without anyone catching sight of your body.", "title": "Let's Get Physical: How Women's Sport Can Conquer Body Image"}
