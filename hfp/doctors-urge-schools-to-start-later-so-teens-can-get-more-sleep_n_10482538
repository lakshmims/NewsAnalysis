The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends teenagers between 14 and 17 years old should get 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep per night.\nThe AMA's new policy, adopted at the group's annual meeting in Chicago, also encourages physicians to educate parents, school administrators and teachers about the importance of sleep for adolescent mental and physical health.\n\u00a0\n(Reporting by Susan Kelly; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "title": "Doctors Urge Schools To Start Later So Teens Can Sleep Longer"}
