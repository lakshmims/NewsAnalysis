Then I received a yellow card and then a red.\u00a0I was shocked, it's the strangest thing I have ever experienced on a football field.\"\n\"I asked the referee: 'What, you can't fart on the field?,' he replied: 'No.'\"\nLjungkvist has\u00a0a theory as to why the ref raised such a stink over a basic bodily function.\n\"Maybe he thought I farted in my hand and threw it at him, but I did not,\" he said, according to HuffPost Canada.\nThe ref in question, Dany Kako, later told the media that Ljungkvist's farting\u00a0was \"deliberate provocation.\"\n\"Once, there was a player who stood and peed next to the pitch. I showed him a yellow card, too,\" Kako said, according to HuffPost Canada.\nLjungkvist's team,\u00a0Pershagen SK, ended up losing the match 5-2, though his removal probably wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game.\nHowever, the player still has strong feelings about the penalty.\n\"I think it was a s***ty call,\" he said, according to Vice Sports. \"I can only laugh about it. This has to be unprecedented, surely. I've never heard of anyone who has been sent off for doing a fart.\"\n\u00a0", "title": "Massive Fart Gets Soccer Player Kicked Out Of Game"}
