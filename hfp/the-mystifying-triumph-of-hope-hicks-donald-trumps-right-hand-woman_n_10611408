She was apologetic for the wait and a little nervous about what I'd come to discuss -- namely, her.\n\n\n\nThe 27-year-old press secretary was clad in a teal dress, and she dug her stilettos into the colorless carpet as she showed me into the office, a room festooned with enough Trump memorabilia to suggest a serial killer's shrine. There before me sat Trump himself, behind his giant desk, upon which there was nothing resembling a computer, a PalmPilot, or even an Etch A Sketch.\n", "title": "The Mystifying Triumph Of Hope Hicks, Donald Trump\u2019s Right-Hand Woman"}
