Briles and his staff allegedly \u201creinforced an overall perception that football was above the rules,\u201d choosing to work to \u201cdiscredit complainants\u201d and \u201cden[y] them the right to a fair, impartial and informed investigation\u201d rather than confront the team\u2019s pervasive, toxic problem head on.\nSo you can see why an unnamed\u00a0relative of one of the alleged rape victims was horrified to learn this week that\u00a0a group of campus power wielders hopes to bring Briles back -- perhaps as early as next year.\nUSA Today\u00a0wrote about the boosters' push. As did the Dallas Morning News. And Baylor interim President David Garland confirmed as much to Dallas\u2019 WFAA-TV in an interview that very same day.The reports went on -- with the school\u2019s former board chairman Gale Galloway declaring that Briles \u201cdeserves to be reinstated.\u201d And while the Baylor board of regents did not end up voting on the matter Monday night as was initially reported, the fact that university leadership would even consider resuscitating the career of a man who did so little to counter a culture of sexual violence was enough to make one family member speak out.\nTalking with FOX Sports on Tuesday, the victim\u2019s relative called it \u201cunbelievable\u201d that board members would \u201centertain the idea\u201d of a Baylor-Briles reunion, later declaring: \"I've hit that point now that I don't know if I can get any madder.\u201d\n\"I'm surprised [the school hasn\u2019t struck down the idea] because it's a place in crisis mode, and they're trying to recover their image,\" the family member said. \"But then again, I'm not really that surprised because obviously this type of thing has been their method of action all along. We were led to believe one thing that was happening, when it wasn't. It's actually very similar to how they handled things before.\u201d\n\"This is a very dirty place that we've seen has been very conniving and low down,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt's hard to fathom because not only is this a university, but it's a Christian university.\"\nHard to fathom indeed.", "title": "Baylor Victim's Family Member Horrified By Push For Art Briles' Return"}
