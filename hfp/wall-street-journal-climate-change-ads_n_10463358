Walt Minnick (D-Idaho), a co-founder of the Partnership, explained in a release. \u201cWhat business and Republican leaders are unlikely to have read on its opinion pages is neither the latest science, nor that there is a bipartisan, business-friendly way to combat climate change. If The Journal won\u2019t cover it, we will.\u201d\nLast December, in response to the historic climate change agreement in Paris, the WSJ's editorial board sneered, \"if climate change really does imperil the Earth, and we doubt it does, nothing coming out of a gaggle of governments and the United Nations will save it.\"\nIn sharp contrast to The Journal, last month the editorial board of the Financial Times, a competing publication, predicted the oil industry is facing\u00a0\"a future of slow and steady decline.\"\n\"Instead of railing against climate policies, or paying them lip-service while quietly defying them with investment decisions,\" the FT's editorial board wrote, \"the oil companies will serve their investors and society better if they accept the limits they face, and embrace a future of long-term decline.\"\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the Partnership for Responsible Growth's ads target the Journal's reporting. If fact, they are meant to call out the paper's editorial board.\u00a0", "title": "Wall Street Journal Ads Call Out The Paper\u2019s Bias On Climate Change"}
