But if the victim was unconscious or severely intoxicated,\u00a0and thus the assailant didn't need to use force because the victim could not resist, judges can sentence offenders to little or no jail time.\u00a0\nThat's what happened in Turner's case, because the judge cited \"unusual circumstances\" on June 2 when he handed down a six-month jail sentence and three years probation to the convicted sex offender. Turner faced as many as 14 years in prison, and Rosen's office requested six years in state prison.\n\"Current law actually incentivizes rapists to get their victims intoxicated before assaulting them,\" Low said. \"While we can\u2019t go back and change what happened, we can make sure it never happens again.\"\u00a0\nTurner's victim was severely intoxicated and unconscious at the time of his assault on her, but the judge said because the former Stanford University student was young and had no previous criminal record, he would give him a less severe punishment.\u00a0\nThe proposal, which denies probation for these types of sex offenders, would have an impact on most campus rape cases, according to a background information from Low and Dodd's office, because a majority of assaults of women in college involve intoxicated victims and offenders.\u00a0\nThe proposal quickly faced skepticism from Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of the activist group UltraViolet, which has been active in a campaign to oust Aaron Persky, the judge in Turner's case. Chaudhary worried the proposal would disproportionately harm minorities and do nothing to hold Persky accountable.\u00a0\n\"While it is long past time that our justice system take the crime of rape seriously, we need judges who focus on finding justice for rape survivors,\" Chaudhary said in a statement, \"not the re-hashing of bad policies that rig the system against poor people and people of color.\"\n_______\nTyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.
