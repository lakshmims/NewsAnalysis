Let's just say we were this close.\u00a0When asked about an upcoming \"Married with Children\" reunion, O'Neill wasn't shy about sharing the disappointing news.\n\"I don't think so, I think we're finished,\" he said of teaming up with former co-stars Katey Sagal (Peggy Bundy), Christina Applegate (Kelly Bundy) and David Faustino (Bud Bundy) for an adaptation. \"There was a rumor ... David Faustino pitched an idea to Sony about Bud moving back in the old house and being divorced and his ex-wife moves in, too, with his best friend and they're struggling and Al and Peg are in Vegas -- they won the lottery. And that was the idea, but I think they hit some legal problems. People who have to sign off on it wouldn't, so I don't think that's going to happen. And Katey and I would only have been able to do one or two a year because we're contracted -- well, she was, now I certainly am. But it doesn't look like that's going to happen. But you never know.\"For now, you can catch O'Neill cracking jokes in \"Finding Dory,\" out in theaters June 17.\u00a0\nWatch the full AOL Build interview with Ed O'Neill below.\u00a0", "title": "Ed O'Neill Shoots Down 'Married With Children' Reunion Rumors"}
