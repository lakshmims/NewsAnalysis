Think again:\u00a0If you recognize either of those memes, you'll understand why we were [hyperventilating in Spanish] when we watched the 4-minute spoof posted to the \"OITNB\"\u00a0Facebook page.\nIn the video, above, Cantoral brings Soraya to life once more\u00a0as a take-no-prisoners prisoner at Litchfield Penitentiary, screaming in Spanish and insulting the likes of Soso, Gloria and Vee. She even has a blast realizing she can curse on the Netflix show. \u00a0\nThe Huffington Post reached out to Netflix about the spoof and, despite rumors that Soraya Montenegro could be a new inmate in Litchfield, the streaming company said her cameo would be limited to the promotional video for Season 4 of the series, which premiered June 17.\u00a0\nAnd now, we're crying in Spanish.\u00a0", "title": "Watch Itat\u00ed Cantoral 'Cry In Spanish' In This Hilarious 'OITNB' Spoof"}
