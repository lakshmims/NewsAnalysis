For one thing, it's unfortunate that abuse allegations are only alluded to in careful language like \"scandal\" or \"personal problems.\"\n\"I don't know whether it passes or not,\" Iger said. \"We have Jack Sparrow\" [referring to having the Jack Sparrow character at the new Shanghai Disneyland]. The Huffington Post has reached out to Disney and Iger for further comment.\nDepp, of course, portrays Captain Jack Sparrow in the Disney franchise \"Pirates of the Caribbean.\" He is set to reprise his role in the upcoming fifth installment of the series, \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\"\u00a0\nHeard filed for divorce\u00a0from the actor after 15 months of marriage in May. In court filings, the actress said that the 53-year-old abused her throughout their marriage.\u00a0\nTo read the rest of THR's interview, head here.\u00a0", "title": "Disney CEO 'Not Worried' About Johnny Depp Abuse Allegations"}
