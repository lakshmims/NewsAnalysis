The charming colonial home comes with four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and 4,397 square feet of pure cinematic nostalgia:Imagine shooting hoops \u00e0 la Steve Martin and Kimberley Williams.\u00a0Aww!\u00a0\nIt's worth noting that not every part of the home will look familiar to prospective buyers: Only the wedding scene and basketball sequence were shot on the property, according to its listing at Compass with agent Ann Gluck. Another home in nearby Pasadena was actually used as the front of the house in the film, Zillow notes.\u00a0\nThe home's value has steadily increased over the years:\u00a0It was last sold for about $1.3 million in 2011, according to Zillow.\u00a0\nHmm, sounds a little steep for a basketball court. Maybe we'll just move in with Mark Wahlberg\u00a0instead.\nHappy house hunting!\u00a0", "title": "The 'Father Of The Bride' House Is For Sale, And It's Just Like The Movies"}
