What this basically amounts to is much crisper imagery when you're using the \"satellite\" function on Google Maps, which shows locations as they would appear in real life.\nThe difference is actually substantial. Google offered two satellite images\u00a0of New York City to showcase the change. It's a night-and-day difference -- move the slider in the middle to see for yourself:As you can see, the new image is more detailed.\u00a0\nGetting such clear photographs involves a lot of data.\n\"We mined data from nearly a petabyte of Landsat imagery\u2014that\u2019s more than 700 trillion individual pixels\u2014to choose the best cloud-free pixels,\" Herwig wrote. \"To put that in perspective, 700 trillion pixels is 7,000 times more pixels than the estimated number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, or 70 times more pixels than the estimated number of galaxies in the Universe.\"\nBottom line? That's a lot of detail. Be careful sunbathing in your backyard this summer.\nAn earlier version of this article used images from Google Maps that may not have been captured by Landsat satellites.
