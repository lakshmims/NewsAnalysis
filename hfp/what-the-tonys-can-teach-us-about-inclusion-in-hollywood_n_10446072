According to an infographic created by Lee & Low Books, while a record number of people of color received acting noms at the Tonys this year, an overwhelming 95 percent of all of the show's nominees were still white:\u00a0It was a landmark time last year on Broadway thanks to shows like \"Hamilton\" and \"The Color Purple.\" Both of these shows have proven that the concept of telling stories written by, starring and about people of color can not only resonate with audiences, but it can also be incredibly successful.\u00a0\nOf course, the powers that be in Hollywood should know that since it's already been established, time and time again, that \"diversity\" works. So while it's important to celebrate the landmark strides writers, directors, producers and performers of color have made on Broadway this year, it's equally important to remember that institutions like Broadway don't just get to pat themselves on the back for not having a dreadful #OscarsSoWhite moment.\nAccording to theater director Christine Toy Johnson, speaking to Lee & Low,\u00a0\"next season does not look nearly as diverse.\"\u00a0However, the true key to diversity is to keep the momentum and the motivation towards inclusion going which is something both Hollywood and Broadway can learn from Sunday night's Tony Awards. Three of the historic musical acting winners\u00a0at the award show were from \"Hamilton.\"\nIf Lin Manuel Miranda had never been able to produce and shine in his first Broadway show, \"In the Heights\" nearly a decade ago, \"Hamilton\" probably would not exist and neither would these historic wins. The beautiful photo above of four black performers at the peak of their careers would probably not exist if it weren't for the fact that a creator of color was empowered years ago to be a true force on Broadway, and ultimately was able to create opportunities for other people of color to shine. That's the key, and that's what both Hollywood and Broadway still need to work on. \u00a0\u00a0", "title": "What The Tonys Can Teach Us About Inclusion In Hollywood"}
