A bigger food budget would allow them to use more of their own cash on things like rent and utilities.\nThe improvements would be small, but so are the dietary differences between the 45 million Americans who receive SNAP benefits and everyone else. Though stories abound of SNAP recipients using their benefits for junk food and soda, federal data show food stamp recipients have only\u00a0marginally worse diets than people who don't get benefits.\u00a0\n\"The whole conversation around healthy eating is about nudging people in a better direction,\" Stacy Dean, a nutrition expert with the Center on Budget, said in an interview.\u00a0\nMost of the political conversation around food stamps, however, is about nudging people off the program. States are in the process of cutting roughly 1 million Americans from SNAP thanks to the return of a federal time limit on benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents. And House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) endorsed further tightening eligibility restrictions on able-bodied recipients of SNAP benefits when he unveiled his poverty agenda last week.\u00a0\nThe average monthly benefit is roughly $126 per person. Two-thirds of beneficiaries are either children, elderly or disabled.\u00a0\nHuffPost readers: Are you an able-bodied adult getting cut off from SNAP?
