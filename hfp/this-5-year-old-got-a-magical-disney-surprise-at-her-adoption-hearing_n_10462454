At the adoption finalization hearing, Danielle got the perfect surprise.\u00a0The magic began after the judge brought up Danielle's love for Disney princesses and then removed her robe to reveal she had dressed up like Snow White for the hearing. Then, she invited a few other guests to join Danielle in the courtroom. That's when Ariel, Cinderella, Elsa and more walked in.The idea started when Danielle's case worker asked a co-worker to dress like Cinderella for the hearing. Once other people in the office heard about the plan, they wanted to join in on the fun. Danielle's face lit up upon their arrival, and after the hearing, she posed for photos with the princesses (and one prince!).\nAccording to BuzzFeed, the Koning family grew even more since the couple also adopted a 1-year-old the same day they adopted Danielle. Samaritas, a social services organization, created a video for the event and shared it on Facebook with the most Disney-appropriate caption: \"Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind.\"\nWatch the video from Samaritas below.In an interview with WZZM, Danielle also gave her adoption finalization hearing her seal of approval.\n\"It was a lot of fun and it made me happy,\" she said. \"And I was happy to see princesses because it was a 'princess day' for me.\"\nCheck out more photos from Danielle's hearing with her family and Disney princess friends below.\u00a0H/T BuzzFeed", "title": "This 5-Year-Old Got A Magical Disney Surprise At Her Adoption Hearing"}
