How many household budgets are subject to the whims of massive corporate interests? Or require a military? (I suppose as the nation inevitably divides itself into gated communities and favelas, we may soon know the answers to these questions.)\nBut leave it to presumptive GOP nominee and\u00a0mucilaginous picklemonger Donald Trump, currently and obliviously touring Brexit-torn Scotland in support of his Trump Turnberry golf course, to arrive at the simple-minded take on modern governance that we all knew he was capable of providing. As The New York Times' Ashley Parker reports:\n\nAt one point, Mr. Trump even compared his renovation of Trump Turnberry with how he is hoping to overhaul the United States as president. When a reporter pointed out \u2014 correctly \u2014 that a country is hardly a golf course, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cNo it\u2019s not, but you\u2019ll be amazed how similar it is. It\u2019s a place that has to be fixed.\u201d\n\nHa, well, if Trump's Scottish golf adventures -- which we've previously discussed at length -- are any guide, then running a golf course is more instructive about how to wheedle government through harangues and failed promises than it is about recognizing how to \"fix\" things. When Trump first arrived in Scotland to found the resort that became Trump International Golf Links, he had to aggressively pester the local governing authorities to grant him the right to build on what was, at the time, an environmentally protected site. As The Atlantic's David Graham reported, Trump's pitch mainly involved \"whining throughout the process that the government was going hard on him despite his plans to invest vast amounts of money in the country.\"\nIn the end, Scottish officials caved, only to later learn that they'd been sold a bill of goods. The 6,000 jobs Trump insisted would create a windfall for the local economy never materialized, Fortune's Michael D'Antonio reported: \"His project has created just 150 jobs, with one golf course, a clubhouse with a restaurant and 19 rooms for rent.\"\nAnd if you want insight into how Trump's golf experiences might inform his governing style, D'Antonio's account is wonderfully illustrative.\u00a0He notes that the ersatz mogul got much of his Scottish land holdings through eminent domain seizures, and he chose the path of petty revenge when he couldn't acquire the property he wanted:\n\nThe political tide began to turn against Trump as Scots learned of how he was bullying the few landowners who refused to sell to him. When Susan Munro rejected his bid to buy her property, she said Trump\u2019s workers built a ten-foot high berm of earth around it, blocking her view. Munro\u2019s neighbor just to the north, David Milne, saw Trump\u2019s men plant evergreens twenty feet from his windows when he refused to sell. To the south, farmer Michael Forbes was attacked --\u00a0his family lived like \u201cpigs,\u201d said Trump \u2014 and the developer\u2019s lawyer approached the local government about taking his land by eminent domain.\n\nIt's really starting to sound like running and maintaining a golf course can be done by any old grubbing bully. (#NotAllGolfCourses, surely.)\nTrump has, of course, staked his presidential claims to the idea that he is, as comedian Nick Kroll might put it, \"good at bizness.\" But those skills aren't as readily transferable to other fields\u00a0as many people believe. Sorry, meritocracy! In fact, as Millsaps College history professor Robert McElvaine noted in 2012,\u00a0\u201cThe startling bottom line is that the nation\u2019s GDP has grown more than 45 times faster under presidents with little or no business experience than it has under presidents with successful business careers.\u201d\nOf course, it's an open question as to whether Trump actually\u00a0is as successful a businessman as he claims. Maybe he's the precise dunce for the job! If you think so, roll them bones. Be sure to be mindful of the fact, however, that Trump gives two surprisingly-tiny-for-an-adult thumbs-up to Brexit because \"when the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry.\" So, if he ever faces a decision where collapsing the economy might be of great benefit to his balance sheet, you're probably going to pay the price for that.\nIn the end, we're reminded of something that truly separated Trump from most of the candidates (we'll leave Ben Carson out) that ran against him for the GOP nomination. A fair-minded observation that anyone can make of Mssrs. Bush, Cruz, Rubio,\u00a0et alia, is that -- irrespective of whatever ideological disagreements you might have with them -- they all convincingly evinced the notion that serving as the American president was a difficult and complicated job, featuring daily encounters with grave decisions that required both diligence and responsibility to properly perform. Trump, on the other hand, thinks that running the country is\u00a0easy. As simple as running a golf course.\nIt's going to be a rough day for all of us when he discovers he's wrong.\u00a0~~~~~\nJason Linkins edits \u201cEat The Press\u201d for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast \u201cSo, That Happened.\u201d Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.", "title": "Donald Trump's Pretty Sure That Governing Country Is As Easy As Owning A Golf Course"}
