One partner is the National Center for Victims of Crime, which helped distribute funds to victims and their families after previous mass shootings in Chattanooga, Tennessee and Aurora, Colorado.\nThe campaign's stated goal is $5 million, double its original goal of $2.5 million. The goal was raised after GoFundMe saw the rate at which individuals were donating money.\nThere has been an outpouring of volunteer and charity support after the weekend's shooting, which left 49 dead and 53 injured. Orlando's Pulse club, where the attack occurred was a center of gay nightlife, and the nation's LGBTQ community\u00a0has come together to grieve and send support to Orlando.\nOrlando-area blood banks were reportedly \"overwhelmed\" by people wanting to donate blood in response to the tragedy, and have even asked potential donors to schedule appointments because their facilities were totally at capacity.\u00a0\n\"Through our grief and through our tears, what remains absolutely constant is our unshakable resolve that we will uproot the bigotry, the fear and the hatred that is at the core of this horror we are enduring,\" Equality Florida posted on its Facebook page. \"That is our pledge, to be unwavering\u2026Love Wins.\"\nSee more ways to help here.\u00a0", "title": "Donors Giving To Orlando Victims\u2019 Fund At A Record Rate"}
