Trappers have taken six alligators from the area.\nThe alligator snatched the toddler on June 14 as he played at the edge of the Seven Seas Lagoon, a manmade lake at the Walt Disney Co resort.\nPolice divers found Lane's body underwater the following afternoon, not far from where he was taken. An autopsy found that he died from drowning and traumatic injuries.\nAt the time, the resort had \"No Swimming\" signs that did not mention alligators. Disney has since installed signs by the lagoon warning guests of alligators and snakes.\n\u00a0\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Daniel Wallis and David Gregorio)", "title": "Authorities Say They Have Likely Removed Alligator That Killed Boy At Disney World Resort"}
