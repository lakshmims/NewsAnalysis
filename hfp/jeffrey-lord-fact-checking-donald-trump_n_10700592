What they care about are what the candidates say.\"\u00a0In lieu of independent fact-checkers, Lord suggested we listen to what the candidates say and just accept everything as fact, unless it's countered by the opposing campaign.\n\"I think the best fact-checkers in a presidential campaign are the opponents \u2014 in this case Hillary and Donald Trump,\" Lord added. \"I think they do a better job of countering the assumptions of the other candidate than fact-checkers.\"\nInspired by that sentiment, here are some \"facts\" about Jeffrey Lord we haven't bothered to fact-check, because unless he counters our assumptions, they must be true!\n\nJeffrey Lord hates puppies.\nJeffrey Lord enjoys listening to Nickelback.\nJeffrey Lord chews with his mouth open.\n", "title": "Trump Surrogate Dismisses Fact-Checking As 'Elitist' And 'Out Of Touch'"}
