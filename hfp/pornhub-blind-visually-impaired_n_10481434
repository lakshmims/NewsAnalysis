Here's a mashup of some of the less-erotic scenes from various enhanced-audio porn clips on the site. The clips contain some expletives, but they're bleeped out, and the actors are clothed.Pornhub Vice President Corey Price says the new genre makes porn more accessible to those who may not otherwise be able to appreciate it.\n\"It\u2019s our way of giving back, and we\u2019re excited to hear what people think,\" Price told The Huffington Post by email. \"With over 60 million people visiting our site each day, we did feel it important to start to include this type of more-accessible content on our platform though, given the relative ambiguity of the concept and the sheer number of people who are visually impaired around the world.\"\nAdding descriptions to existing videos was a challenge, Price said.\n\"We put a considerable amount of effort into having the scripts for the added audio tracks be descriptive and enticing, to add enough while leaving enough space for the video\u2019s original audio and having everything match up just right,\" he explained.\nDescribed video is intended for visually impaired porn fans, but Price suspects it may have broader appeal.\u00a0\"Will they like it more than the videos they are accustomed to? You never know. Some just might,\" he said.\nIt's too soon to tell if the videos will be a hit with visually impaired people, however.\nHuffPost reached out to the National Federation of the Blind, but the group declined to comment.\nStill, Price is enthusiastic enough about his site's audience-expanding efforts to consider close-captioning grunts and moans for the hearing-impaired.\n\"This initiative is meant to mark the start of a larger dialogue surrounding accessibility and our site and how we can do better,\" he said.\nWhether the website can do anything for people with no sense of taste is another matter entirely.", "title": "Pornhub Wants To Be More Accessible To The Blind"}
