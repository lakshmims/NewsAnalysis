It's taken me some time to process it and understand it. I don't expect you to understand right here, right now, it took me a long time too,'\u00a0Simkhai recalled for the latest episode of The Huffington Post\u2019s Talk To Me interview series. That coming out conversation, he noted, took place at New York's Grand Central Station.\u00a0\nFor the series, Simkhai had a casual -- but serious -- chat with parents Beni and Orna and two brothers, Jonathan and Amir, both of whom also identify as gay. The conversation also touched on Simkhai's concerns for the global LGBT community.\u00a0\nPointing to those living in Asia, Russia and the Middle East,\u00a0Simkhai said, \"Unfortunately, not everyone has supportive parents and not everyone has supportive families, and that makes it tough.\u00a0That doesn't mean you should deny who you are or not be comfortable with who you are.\"\u00a0\nSimkhai, who was born in Israel but relocated to the U.S. with his family when he was 3, believes that being gay and an immigrant to the U.S. has allowed him to \"think differently.\" \u00a0\n\"I actually like when people tells me things aren't possible,\" he said. \"I think part of that comes from being gay and being different than a lot of people and forcing me to think in a different way.\" \u00a0\nTo those who judge him and his brothers for their sexuality,\u00a0Simkhai has just two words: \"Screw you.\"\u00a0", "title": "Grindr CEO And His Brothers Recall The Moment They Knew They Were Gay"}
