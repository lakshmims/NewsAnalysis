When detectives learned Green was on house arrest, they asked the city Pretrial Services Agency for his whereabouts on the day of the shooting. The GPS tracker showed he was at home, police said -- and remained there days later.\nInvestigators\u00a0checked camera footage from the area near the shooting and spotted a gunman with an obvious limp, according to FoxDC. Inside Green's home, police with a search\u00a0warrant discovered a box in his living room containing the prosthetic leg with the tracking device still attached to the ankle.\nCliff Keenan, director of the DC Pretrial Services Agency, told FoxDC the leg monitor mistake was \"human error\" on the part of the technician, an employee for California-based Sentinel Services.\n\"One would assume that the person doing the installation would know not to put it on to a prosthetic device,\" Keenan said. \"We don't know what the company has been able to find out about how this happened under these particular circumstances, other than it was a violation of protocols.\"\nSentinel spokesman Chris McDowell told The Washington Post that the company's protocol was \"absolutely not\" followed in Green's case.\u00a0\nThe technician who fitted Green for the tracker put the device over a sock and didn't notice the leg was artificial, McDowell said.\u00a0Monitors are supposed to be affixed tightly to skin, never over clothing.\n\u201cWe believe it was absolutely human error,\u201d McDowell told the paper.\nThe victim's mother, Lillie Hamilton, is still coming to grips with her son's death.\n\"I\u2019m just so hurt and I just hope I can deal with it.\u00a0It\u2019s just really getting to me.\" Hamilton told WUSA TV. \u00a0\"This is the worst that\u2019s really happened to me all my life and I\u2019m 72 years old.\n\"Why would they put it on a prosthetic leg?\u00a0When it was supposed to go on the person\u2019s real leg?\"\n\u00a0", "title": "Murder Suspect Eludes Arrest By Ditching Prosthetic Leg With GPS Tracker"}
