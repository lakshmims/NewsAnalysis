A gentleman just got out of his car and is naked standing in front of my door. He just peed on my door and now he\u2019s walking inside. \u2018Sir, you cannot come in here.\u2019\"\nDerwin Rodgers said he was attempting to eat when he saw the brazen display of flesh outside his window.\nInstead of eating his vittles, Rodgers decided to go viral by live streaming the incident. \n\"It kind of shocked me as a customer, ruined my meal,\u201d Rodgers told WSB TV. \u201cI immediately went to video. \u00a0I didn't know what he was going to do.\"\nRodgers told the station that something was obviously wrong with the naked suspect.\n\u201cHe was saying a lot of different things. \u00a0He's hot, he's burning up. Apparently he was. It must have been Death Valley out here. He was butt naked,\" Rodgers told the station.\nStill, the incident presented a challenging parenting moment for Rodgers.\n\u201cI wouldn't know how to tell my kid what was going on at that time, to see a grown man,\" he told the station, adding, \"He was built like a potato.\"\nHere is a clip of what Rodgers' live streamed:\n\u00a0Eventually, Rasheed retreated to his car and was arrested a short time later.\nOfficers said he was just coherent enough to identify himself to authorities since, as WBRZ.com pointed out, he obviously didn't have pockets for his wallet.\nHowever, Rasheed was unable to explain to officers why he was naked. \nEven worse: Officers said the suspect grabbed himself and began to urinate while they were still talking, according to the arrest report.\nRasheed was medically evaluated at a nearby hospital before being cited for public indecency and released, according to the station.", "title": "Naked Man Exposes His Sausage At Waffle House"}
