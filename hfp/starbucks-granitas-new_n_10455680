There are, of course, Frappuccinos and Refreshers, to start with. And most recently, it even released a brand new nitro cold brew. But none have tickled our summertime-loving-senses quite like this before.\u00a0\nLadies and gentlemen, we give you ... Starbucks granitas:Yes, the beloved coffee chain has introduced shaved ice beverages as part of its new \"sunset menu,\" debuting June 14 and available at participating Starbucks after 3 p.m. daily throughout the summer.\u00a0\nThe icy, sweet treats come in three flavors: Youthberry White Tea, Strawberry Lemon Limeade and what sounds like is going to be our personal favorite, the Caramel Espresso granita, made with espresso, cream and a caramel drizzle.At 19 grams of sugar for the caramel, 25 grams for the white tea and 30 in the strawberry lemon limeade (for the brand's \"tall\" 12-ounce size), the granitas aren't much of a healthier option than a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola, which has 39 grams of sugar. So while we wouldn't recommend drinking one every day, they're still an alcohol-free alternative to those oh-so-trendy ombr\u00e9 wine slushies\u00a0that have sent the internet into a frozen-drink induced frenzy.\nAlthough, if you wanted to add a drop or two of Kahlua in there, who are we to stop you?\n\u00a0", "title": "Starbucks Hops On The Granita Trend Just In Time For Summer"}
