Stewart has partnered with Marley Spoon, a two-year-old meal delivery service company that operates in Europe, Australia and now the U.S. The new venture, named Martha & Marley Spoon, hopes to entice die-hard Martha fans\u00a0to try their service by getting them one step closer to cooking like her.\u00a0The service works like most: pick a number of people you want to feed and a number of meals you want delivered. Each week you can choose from seven different recipes. Here's where Martha & Marley Spoon hope to set themselves apart from the rest: One of the biggest complaints people have with meal plan services is that the recipes aren't always well tested, but with Martha this is not an issue. Her recipes are spot on. The meals\u00a0come out delicious, every time.\u00a0\u00a0\nHere's an example of what a week of recipes looks like:We know, we want to eat them all, too.\nMartha & Marley Spoon costs\u00a0$10.25 a serving for the two-person plan and\u00a0$8.90 per serving for the family box (which feeds two adults and two kids). They claim that those prices are competitive with doing the shopping yourself:\u00a0So now that you can cook up your Martha meal on your Martha tableset and truly channel this lifestyle guru, would you try it?
