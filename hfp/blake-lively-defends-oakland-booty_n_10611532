She\u2019s saying she\u2019s proud of her butt. I\u2019m glad she embraced the look, because that\u2019s what I wanted [with the song].\u201d\nAddressing his comments, Lively described the rapper as \"very defensive and kind\" in her radio interview, explaining to Calloway that \"it's just about celebrating women's bodies, and that's what I was doing.\"\nListen to a clip of the interview below:\u00a0", "title": "Blake Lively Is Still Standing By That 'Oakland Booty' Mess For Some Reason"}
