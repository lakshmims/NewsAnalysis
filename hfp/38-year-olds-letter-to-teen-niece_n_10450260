It\u2019s not anything that I set out to do. It\u2019s kind of the path that we went down.\u201dHowever, Grace\u2019s mother, Bridget, says she fears Kevin may be engaging in an inappropriate relationship with her now 16-year-old daughter. \u201cHis car would be in my driveway when he should have been at work,\u201d Bridget says. \u201cThey spent a lot of time in Grace\u2019s room with the door closed.\u201dBridget says then she found an empty bottle of whipped cream behind a stack of DVDs in Grace\u2019s room, so she started to snoop and found a letter that Kevin had written to Grace. \u201cWhen I read it, I was physically ill,\u201d Bridget says. \u201cI felt that something inappropriate had happened.\u201dIn the video above, Dr. Phil reads parts of the letter that Kevin wrote to Grace, including, \u201c\u2019I love you with all of my heart. The way I love you is unique, and I don\u2019t even know how to explain it \u2026 You will be dating and eventually find a guy. I\u2019d be lying if I said there was a part of me that doesn\u2019t like it, though. LOL. You have also made me feel very special, wanting to be around me ... I don\u2019t care that you are only 16. You are one of my best friends in the world.\u2019\u201dKevin strongly denies having an inappropriate relationship with his niece and claims that he\u2019s just trying to be a father figure since Grace\u2019s dad passed away.Dr. Phil also plays a video Kevin sent to the show in which Kevin questions his relationship with Grace, and Dr. Phil asks Bridget, \u201cDoes that sound normative to you?\u201dHear what Dr. Phil has to say to both Bridget and Grace. And on Tuesday, hear more from Uncle Kevin \u2014 watch a preview here.", "title": "38-Year-Old\u2019s Letter To 16-Year-Old Niece: \u2018The Way I Love You Is Unique\u2019"}
