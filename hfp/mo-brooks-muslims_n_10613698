Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) to apologize\u00a0for previously claiming that Muslims want to kill every gay person in the nation. The group also invited the congressman to attend a Ramadan interfaith dinner at a local mosque so he could actually meet some of the constituents he had offended.\nIn an appearance on Alabama talk radio\u00a0June 16, Brooks claimed it was \u201cmainstream Muslim thought\u201d to seek the eradication of the LGBT community.\n\u201cDemocrats are in a perplexing position,\u201d said the congressman, because \u201con the one hand, they\u2019re trying to appeal to the gay community, but, on the other hand, they\u2019re trying to also appeal to the Muslim community, which, if it had its way, would kill every homosexual in the United States of America.\u201d\nCAIR, the nation's largest Muslim advocacy group, says that's simply not true.\n\u201cAmerican Muslims are committed to upholding equal rights and protections for all as the law of the land as enshrined in the U.S. Constitution,\u201d CAIR-Alabama Executive Director Khaula Hadeed said in a statement.\n\u201cCongressman Brooks\u2019 [sic] would seek to create division between the LGBTQIA and Muslim community standing shoulder-to-shoulder as we confront together hate crimes, bigotry, marginalization and discrimination,\u201d added Hadeed. \"Alabama Muslims join their fellow Americans in unequivocally and unconditionally denouncing Sunday\u2019s mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando.\"\nHadeed went on to describe the Orlando gunman as one of the \"enemies of the [Islamic] faith and indeed, of humanity.\u201d While Omar Mateen, a U.S. citizen, pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State during the shooting, reports about his own homosexuality, abusiveness and mental instability have led to questions about what role, if any, Mateen's faith actually played in this tragedy.\u00a0\ufeff\nBe that as it may,\u00a0Brooks made it clear in an interview with WAFF\u00a0that he's just fine accusing an entire religion of 1.6 billion people of being violent homophobes.\u00a0\n\"There is no way on gods green Earth that I'll apologize for CAIR or the Council for American Islamic Republic, as it's commonly known in Washington,\u00a0for pointing out that Islam inspires people to hate and kill homosexuals,\u00a0kill people and for that matter, other non-Muslim peoples,\" he said.\u00a0He didn't mention whether he would accept the dinner invite.\nThe Islamic holy month of Ramadan will end in the first week of July, with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "title": "Muslim Group Invites Islamophobic Congressman To Dinner, And He's A Total Jerk About It"}
