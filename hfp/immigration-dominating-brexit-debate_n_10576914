Mair's family said\u00a0he had a history of mental illness. Both \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" supporters universally condemned the attack.\u00a0\nCox\u2019s death\u00a0sent shock waves through Britain, casting a somber shadow on the country\u2019s upcoming EU referendum on Thursday, and forcing harsh questions on the dark direction the Brexit debate has taken.\nMair's comments specifically stoked concerns surrounding the dangers of rising anti-immigration rhetoric\u00a0as the referendum draws nearer.\u00a0Baroness Warsi,\u00a0former chairman of the Conservative Party, made news on Monday when she cited an \"environment of hate\" within parts of the \"Leave\" camp as inspiration behind her decision to switch to \"Remain.\"\u00a0Specifically, Warsi cited a controversial poster released by anti-EU UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage last Thursday, which showed a large group of refugees walking through Slovenia and implied that Britain wouldn't be able to control its borders as part of the EU. Politicians on both sides of the debate expressed deep concerns\u00a0over the poster, criticizing its scare tactics and xenophobic message.\nAmid investigations into the potential motives of Mair's heinous crime and last-ditch efforts\u00a0from pro- and anti-EU camps, the topic of immigration continues to be a defining factor in Britain's referendum, with the vote just days away.\u00a0According to the most recent data from the Office for National Statistics, the U.K.'s net immigration rate is 333,000 per year, with 184,000 coming from within the EU.\u00a0The country is also among the top four hosts of non-EU nationals in Europe, the International Organization for Migration says.\nPublic polls have found that\u00a03-in-4 Brits say they favor reducing inward migration flows, and only 11 percent view EU immigration as having a positive impact on national life, spurring politicians on both sides of the debate to try to address the issue.\nEurosceptic politicians ranging from Conservative member Boris Johnson to UKIP's\u00a0Farage\u00a0have attracted attention in part by vowing to dramatically reduce migratory flow post-Brexit. Prime Minister David Cameron, leading the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign effort, has rebuked these claims, calling such promises \"madness.\" In the face of nationwide pressure to address the influx of newcomers, he assured voters that immigration can be controlled from within the EU.The \"Leave\" Campaign And Immigration\nMany prominent proponents of Britain leaving the EU have argued that it would help the country reduce its levels of immigration. Brexit supporters range from the hard-line conservative anti-immigration party UKIP, to a large part of the more moderate ruling Conservative Party.\nEurosceptic and Conservative employment minister Priti Patel argued Tuesday during a debate co-hosted by HuffPost UK\u00a0that Britain is not fully in control of its immigration policies as a result of its EU membership -- a view shared by many pro-Brexit Brits. A recent ORB/Telegraph poll\u00a0of 800 voters revealed that 52 percent believed a Brexit would improve the U.K.'s immigration system.\nPatel argued that free movement -- one of the EU's fundamental principles that enables its citizens to work and live in other member states without obtaining a work permit -- has yielded a much higher number of immigrants in Britain than anticipated.\n\"The correlation between hostility to immigration and support for Brexit is high,\" The Economist observed back in April, \"so if [\"Leave\" campaigners] can turn the vote into one about migration, they will win.\" Of late, Brexiteers have framed the topic as a key pillar of their platform, one they deem can best be addressed once outside of the EU. \n\"I think most people in this country feel that is very high indeed, and probably too high,\" Johnson, the former mayor of London and a leading voice in the pro-Brexit movement, said Tuesday of Britain's net immigration rate.Emphasizing the need for national control over policymaking, Johnson explained why he believes immigration has become such a hot topic.\n\"It's control that matters, because there's a reason why across Europe, you are seeing the rise of far-right parties,\" he explained. \"There's a reason why you're seeing immigration escalated in the whole conversation at the moment. And that is, I think, because people feel that they haven't given democratic consent to what is happening.\"\nFarage, a controversial conservative and longtime critic of EU immigration laws, has directed harsh words at Cameron's tireless \"Remain\" campaign and called the EU \u201cnot just bad for Britain\u201d but \u201cbad for the whole of Europe.\u201d He suggested last year that the net immigration rate should be dramatically cut down to 30,000 newcomers annually, to restore Britain \"to normality.\" Yet when asked what would happen following a British departure from the EU, Farage admitted he had \u201cabsolutely no idea.\u201dLast Thursday, one week before the vote, the outspoken politician tweeted a photo showing the poster of a long line of migrants waiting to enter Europe, immediately garnering negative criticism on social media and stirring derision among many politicians on both sides of the issue. \nFarage's latest antics were part of a string of anti-immigration comments made by politicians ahead of this week's momentous vote. They came on the heels of remarks by pro-Brexit Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom, who seemed to lament some newcomers' inability to speak English in a recent interview with The Guardian.\n\u201cIf you come here and you don\u2019t speak English, and you don\u2019t know the customs and you don\u2019t know where to live and you don\u2019t have a job, it\u2019s really difficult for everybody. It\u2019s really difficult to make you welcome,\u201d she said, prompting some \"Remain\" advocates to denounce her comments as fuel for the nation\u2019s widespread anti-immigration sentiment.\nCameron has also urged immigrants to learn English, saying it would give them greater access to opportunities without discrimination.The \"Remain\" Campaign And Immigration\nWhile those vying to leave the EU have asserted that the U.K.'s current immigration rates are unsustainable, taking a toll on the economy and threatening national security, British Chancellor George Osborne recently denied rumors of a pledge to cap EU immigration rates to appease voters ahead of the referendum.\nMany EU backers like Labour Party MP Liz Kendall insist that immigrants bring greater benefit than burden to British society in the long run. \u00a0\nShe attributed the oft-bemoaned pressures mounting on Britain's health care system to government cuts and an aging population rather than immigrants, whom she described as \"younger, healthier and of working age.\" \nImmigrants actually contribute a \"huge amount\" to the U.K., Kendall argued. \"They do pay in more than they take out. Our [National Health Service] would struggle without the contribution that migrants make.\"\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn echoed Kendall's sentiment at a recent speech in Yorkshire.\n\u201cToo many voices in this debate are only playing that old trick, the blame game,\" he said, suggesting pro-Brexit politicians have scapegoated immigrants for national job insecurity and low wages. \u201cNow they want to use people\u2019s real concerns about the impact of EU migration to turn the campaign into a referendum on immigration.\u201d\nFormer Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond,\u00a0a prominent voice in the anti-Brexit movement, highlighted the flip side of the immigration debate: the outward flow of migrants. Salmond expressed his belief that emigration is an equally if not more troubling problem facing Britain. \n\"I've seen emigration and depopulation, and believe me, it's a lot worse, the problems it causes,\" he warned.What We Know About Immigration To Britain And The Economy\nWhile some British economists have warned of the consequences a sustained influx of migrants could have on Britain's economy, studies including a 44-page report from the Bank of England, published in December and cited by politicians on both sides of the debate, show that the effects immigration rates have on labor wages overall are minimal.\nThose in the semi- and unskilled services sector bear the brunt of immigration-related wage impacts, with \u201ca 10 percentage point rise in the proportion of immigrants [being] associated with a 2 percent reduction in pay,\" the study notes.\n\"Remain\" supporters have also pointed to the many unknowns surrounding a post-Brexit economy. The Economist\u00a0recently considered what the outcome might be if anti-immigration Brexiteers were to get their wish, and the sort of economic toll curbing immigration might introduce. \u00a0\n\"Were Britain to impose tighter controls on EU migrants post-Brexit, growth would depend on attracting from elsewhere the skills its economy needs,\" the London-based magazine concluded. \"Yet it is politically unrealistic to believe that Britons who have just voted to leave the EU partly to curb uncontrolled migration from eastern Europe will want to welcome many more migrants from places like India and Africa.\"\nLooking beyond immigration to general concerns surrounding the economy, EU backers have pointed to the uncertainty that would cloud future trade deals should a Brexit occur, with U.S. President Barack Obama warning in April that leaving the EU would push the U.K.\u00a0to the \u201cback of the queue\u201d in trade talks with America. Brexiteers have denounced his rhetoric as \u201cthreatening.\u201d\n\u201cThe president made clear that uncontrolled immigration into the EU is a threat to national security. I agree \u2013 that is why it is safer to take back control so that we can stop terror suspects from Europe coming into the UK,\u201d retorted Conservative MP Dominic Raab. \u201cHe argued that he thinks it is in America\u2019s interests for the U.K. to stay in the EU, but what is good for U.S. politicians is not necessarily good for the British people.\u201dWhat We Know About Immigration To Britain And National Security\nJust as the U.S. saw presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump exploit fear in the wake of the Orlando massacre to advance his immigration proposals, many in the U.K. like Salmond have accused the \"Leave\" supporters of falsely painting immigrants as dangerous and a threat to national security.\n\"I am fed up in this campaign seeing [immigrants] presented as a negative. It's not fair, it's not right, and it's not true,\" he snapped during Tuesday's debate.\nIn late March the \"Vote Leave\u201d campaign, backed in varying degrees by Conservative Michael Gove as well as Raab, Patel and Johnson, published a list of convicted killers and rapists who were allowed to enter the U.K. from other EU states to highlight the purported dangers associated with free movement.\n\"Every EU citizen has a right to enter the U.K. under EU law. But EU law does not require other EU member states to inform the U.K. on a systematic basis of the criminal records of their nationals, creating an effective right of free movement for criminals,\" the campaign notes in a statement on its website.\nIn fact, movement within the EU can be restricted \"on grounds of public policy, public security or public health,\" in circumstances that represent \"a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat\u201d to society's core interests, according to the Official Journal of the European Union\u2019s citizenship directive outlines.\nThe U.K. has refused entry to more than 100,000 people since 2010, including over 6,500 EU nationals, a British immigration official told the BBC in April.\nPraising the EU's European Arrest Warrant, which was introduced to simplify law enforcement officials' handling of cross-border crimes, Salmond concluded: \"Cooperation on security matters between democracies is always a good thing to make all of us safer.\"\u00a0\nRead more coverage:\n\n\nThe Life Of British Lawmaker Jo Cox, From Aid Worker To Rising Political Star\n\n\nLabour Member Of Parliament Killed In Shooting\n\n\nJo Cox Truly Was \u2018Passionate, Compassionate and Loyal\u2019\n\n\nHuffPost UK\u2019s Interview With Jo Cox: All Parties Need To Work Together To Solve The Social Care Crisis\n\n\nBritish Lawmaker\u2019s Killing Highlights Dangers Of Far-Right Nationalism\n\n", "title": "Immigration Concerns Continue To Dominate Brexit Debate As Referendum Approaches"}
