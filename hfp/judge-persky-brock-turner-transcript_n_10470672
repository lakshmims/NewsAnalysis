That\u2019s an element of the crime. ... So I have considered that.\"\nPersky's sentence for the Jan. 18, 2015, attack has stirred international outrage. Two online petitions demanding Persky's ouster have each accumulated more than 1 million signatures. Members of Congress and the California legislature have signaled support for that effort.\nProsecutors during the hearing requested Turner be sentenced to six years in state prison.\u00a0District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement afterward that the \u201cpunishment does not fit the crime.\u201dThis week, the Santa Clara County court recorder began releasing the hearing transcript after requests from several media outlets, including The Huffington Post. The Guardian website\u00a0posted the full transcript on Tuesday.\nPersky brought up the issue of alcohol several times, according to the transcript, but repeatedly said it was a minor factor in his decision. Turner's blood alcohol level was 0.13, and the victim's was estimated to be 0.24 -- three times the legal limit for driving.\n\"I have also considered the fact that he was legally intoxicated at the time of the incident,\" Persky said of Turner. \"Pursuant to the evidence at trial, this does affect judgment. And as I indicated previously, it\u2019s not an -- and, I think, as [the victim] wrote -- it\u2019s not an excuse. But it is a factor. And I think it is a factor that, when trying to assess moral culpability in this situation, is mitigating.\"\nPersky continued:\u00a0\"The argument can be made that it\u2019s more morally culpable for someone with no alcohol in their system to commit an offense like that than with someone who was legally intoxicated at the rate of 0.16 or so.\" The judge added that he was not \"relying on that\" reasoning.\nU.S. Rep Ted Poe (R-Texas) told HuffPost last week that Persky got the sentence \"wrong.\"\n\"Alcohol makes it worse -- it doesn\u2019t mitigate it, it makes it worse,\" Poe said.\nTurner, in his statements to the court, blamed alcohol for his behavior.\u00a0Persky ran through other factors, including that Turner was not armed, showed no\u00a0\"criminal sophistication,\" and had no previous criminal convictions, though he had a pending charge of possessing alcohol as a minor.\u00a0\nCourt documents show Turner failed to acknowledge he committed an assault. Even after a jury convicted him, he insisted his actions were consensual, according to the documents. \u00a0\n\"Mr. Turner came before us today and said he was genuinely sorry for all the pain that he has caused to [the woman] and her family,\" Persky said. \"And I think that is a genuine feeling of remorse.\u00a0[The woman] has stated that he hasn\u2019t really taken responsibility for his conduct. And I think at one point she basically wrote or said that 'He --\u00a0he just doesn\u2019t get it.'\n\"And so you have Mr. Turner expressing remorse, which I think, subjectively, is genuine, and [the woman] not seeing that as a genuine expression of remorse because he never says, 'I did this. I knew how drunk you were. I knew how out of it you were, and I did it anyway,'\" Persky continued. \"And that -- I don\u2019t think that bridge will, probably, ever be crossed.\"\nPersky added: \"I\u2019m not convinced that his lack of complete acquiescence to the verdict should count against him with respect to an expression of remorse because I do find that his remorse is genuine.\"\nTurner is scheduled to be released from jail on Sept. 2.\u00a0\n_______\u00a0\nTyler Kingkade covers higher education and sexual violence and is based in New York.
