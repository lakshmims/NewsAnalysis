Hill and Prince had been talking over dinner, when she watched as Prince's eyes \"fixed,\" and he slipped into unconsciousness.\u00a0\n\"We knew it was only a matter of time; we had to get down,\" Hill said of the emergency landing. \"We didn\u2019t have anything on the plane to help him.\"\nThe plane landed at 1:17 a.m. in Moline, Illinois, where paramedics gave the singer a shot of Narcan, which is used to treat opioid overdoses. Prince was then taken to the hospital, and by the time he got there, Hill said he was alert and talkative.\u00a0\"He wasn't dreary or drowsy or anything,\" the singer said.\u00a0\"He wanted to watch 'Zootopia.' He loved those films. I was going to pull it up on my phone. He said: 'No, no, no, not here. We're going to pick a special time and place to watch that.'\"\u00a0\nThough Hill declined to talk about the type of treatment Prince received that night, she says she tipped off friends in his inner circle about his health scare -- the Times states that a few people close to Prince already knew of his addiction to painkillers.\nJust a few days later, Prince was found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Minnesota. According to a report released by the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office in early June,\u00a0Prince died from an overdose of fentanyl, a synthetic opiate nearly 80 times more potent than morphine and hundreds of times more potent than heroin.\u00a0For Hill, the death was especially difficult to fathom considering Prince had seemed\u00a0\"cooperative\" and \"serious about getting help\" after his hospital scare.\u00a0\n\"And that\u2019s the part that breaks my heart, because he was trying,\" Hill said. \"He was trying.\"\u00a0\nTo read the rest of Hill's interview with the New York Times, head here.", "title": "Prince Prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Recalls Emergency Plane Landing The Week Before His Death"}
