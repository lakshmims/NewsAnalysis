We are terrified. We are in mourning,\"\u00a0HuffPost Voices Editorial Director Noah Michelson wrote. \"But we aren\u2019t alone and we must not let anything stop us from continuing our fight to be heard, to be seen, to be respected and to be free.\"\nIn keeping with that mindset, The Huffington Post asked its readers to share photos of themselves kissing their same-sex partners -- or those who they found hot, smart or kind -- on Twitter with the hashtag #KeepKissing. In doing so, HuffPost hopes to encourage the world, especially those in the queer community, to stand unafraid in the face of hate.\nBelow are 43 of our favorite submissions. \u00a0Want to submit a photo and show support but don't want to use your Twitter account?\nSubmit a photo and message using the button below, and we'll add it to this page and our partners at LifePosts will tweet it out with the #keepkissing hashtag.\u00a0Donate to Orlando here:", "title": "43 Photos Of Queer Couples Kissing That Show Love Is Stronger Than Hate"}
