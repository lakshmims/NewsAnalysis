The beleaguered Mediterranean country has high hopes for the new process, which aims to expedite family reunification requests and relocation efforts for those seeking to settle elsewhere in the EU.\u00a0\nAs many as\u00a057,000 migrants and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflict-ridden areas who had been attempting to reach western Europe have been stuck in Greece since Balkan countries closed their borders in early March. That decision left\u00a0many refugees and migrants stranded for months in makeshift camps with little hope and in increasingly harsh living conditions \u2014 most notably evidenced by the recently evacuated Idomeni camp.\nThe new pre-registration process, funded by the European Commission and run by the Greek Asylum Service, the UN refugee agency and the European Asylum Support Office, hopes to meet the demand for access to international protection from the tens of thousands of people currently residing in temporary accommodation sites in Greece. \nIn the first three days following the launch of the new registration process, 1,200 people were pre-registered at camps in Athens and the coastal town of Thessaloniki.\u00a0\nSpeaking to the press at the Elliniko refugee camp in Athens -- where the registration in the capital takes place --\u00a0on June 13, director of Greece\u2019s Asylum Service Maria Stavropoulou explained that the goal is to register 1,400 asylum seekers each day, in two sites, over two months. \n\u201cEach asylum claim is examined on an individual basis,\u201d Katerina Kitidi, of UNHCR Greece, said. \u201cIf someone is in need of protection, they can be granted asylum, even if they don\u2019t come from a war-torn country,\u201d she explained.\nUnder the recent EU-Turkey deal, which aims to stem the flow of refugees entering Europe, people currently stranded in Greece are required to apply for asylum to be relocated to other countries in the EU or reunited with their families. They also have the option of requesting asylum in Greece, which may or may not be approved, depending on individual circumstances. The number of claims filed by stranded refugees and migrants have overwhelmed Greek authorities, slowing down the process.\nThe pre-registration operation that Greece just launched is intended to accelerate matters by identifying the nationalities of asylum seekers and discerning the most vulnerable cases before them -- such as unaccompanied minors, people with urgent medical conditions or single-parent families.\nAs soon as asylum seekers complete their pre-registration for asylum, they will receive an asylum seeker\u2019s card that allows them to stay in Greece legally, as well as access basic services, until the country has made a decision on the asylum request,\u00a0according to UNHCR.\nBefore the new process was instituted, asylum seekers had no legal status while they waited for their asylum applications to be examined.\n\u201cIt's important to give everyone the right to enter the asylum process here, even if some people will not eventually get it,\u201d Kitidi pointed out.\nWhile the project kicked off in cities including Athens and Thessaloniki, its implementation has been delayed on the Greek island Chios until June 17, causing anger among the more than 2,000 refugees in the camps there, Al Jazeera reported.\nIn the capital, the process is conducted at the Elliniko camp, located just a few meters away from the buildings which shelter almost 3,500 people.\nElliniko, the site of Athens\u2019 former airport and later served as a venue for the 2004 Olympic Games, is a dilapidated complex decried for its squalid conditions by many human rights organizations. Overcrowding in the camp has worsened conditions, leading to mounting\u00a0tension and breakouts of violence among its inhabitants. The migration minister has said that the evacuation of Elliniko is among the government's top priorities. \nStavropoulou thinks the new procedures will help reduce levels of frustration and hopefully ease tensions. \n\u201cPeople will get a sense that something is coming in the future, so they will feel like they have options,\u201d she said. \u00a0\nThe Greek Asylum Service has promised to send a text message by the end of July to people who have pre-registered, informing them of the date and location of their next appointment. \u00a0\nDanae Leivada reported from Athens.
