In\u00a0a Monday Facebook post,\u00a0Trump said the \"phony and dishonest\" Post was losing its press credentials due to its \"incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign.\"\nIn a subsequent Facebook post, Trump criticized the Post for reporting on his suggestion that Obama identifies with terrorists and is somehow linked to Sunday's mass shooting in Orlando, Florida.Trump's announcement about revoking the Post's credentials came after the paper changed the headline he cited to, \"Donald Trump seems to connect President Obama to Orlando shooting.\"\n\u201cWe changed the headline shortly after it posted to more properly reflect what Trump said,\u201d a Post spokeswoman told HuffPost. \u201cWe did so on our own; the Trump campaign never contacted us about it.\u201d\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\nThe campaign's decision\u00a0\"is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press,\" said Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor.\n\"When coverage doesn\u2019t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished,\" Baron said. \"The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along \u2013 honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly.\u00a0 We\u2019re proud of our coverage, and we\u2019re going to keep at it.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign has denied press credentials to numerous outlets this year, including The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, The Daily Beast, Univision, Fusion, Mother Jones, Politico and the National Review. His team has also\u00a0placed severe restrictions on journalists who do receive credentials, often barring reporters from leaving the designated \"press pen.\" Campaign manager Corey Lewandowski threatened to blacklist a reporter for leaving the pen at an event and physically grabbed\u00a0another while she was attempting to ask Trump a question.\u00a0\nThe Post, which took Trump's campaign seriously in the spring of 2015 when many other media outlets did not, has enjoyed good access to the candidate since then. Trump has given several interviews to reporter Robert Costa and others covering the race for the paper.\nBut the relationship began showing signs of strain after The Post\u00a0deployed dozens of journalists to investigating Trump's past for an upcoming book. And recently, reporter David Fahrenthold attracted Trump's ire after pressing his campaign for months\u00a0about his claims\u00a0that he donated $6 million to veterans' groups.\nLast month, Trump accused\u00a0Post owner and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos of using the paper's influence to reduce his technology company's taxes. \"Amazon is getting away with murder, tax-wise,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview, suggesting that Bezos is wielding the Post against his campaign out of fear that he'd tackle Amazon's\u00a0\"huge antitrust problem\" as president.\n\u201cAmazon is controlling so much of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd what they\u2019ve done is he bought this paper for practically nothing, and he\u2019s using that as a tool for political power against me and against other people, and I\u2019ll tell you what, we can\u2019t let him get away with it.\u201d\nTrump's threats are\u00a0\u201cnot an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave,\u201d Bezos said last month at a Q&A session moderated by Baron, who has said the paper's owner isn't interfering in election coverage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I can say categorically that I have received no instructions from Jeff Bezos regarding our coverage of the presidential campaign \u2014 or, for that matter, any other subject,\" he said.\nThis article has been updated to include comment from The Washington Post.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Blacklists The Washington Post In Latest Assault On The Press"}
