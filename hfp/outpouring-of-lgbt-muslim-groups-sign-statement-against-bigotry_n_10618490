Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump chose to leverage the tragedy\u00a0by reinforcing his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. He also accused President Barack Obama of sympathizing with the shooter, who reportedly\u00a0pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State in a call with police during the shooting.\u00a0Many Muslim Americans feared backlash after the shooting, though religious leaders from different faiths urged the American public not to blame the actions of one sick individual on an entire faith.\nThe massacre also shed light on latent homophobia running through many faiths and communities in the country. One Northern California pastor made headlines for praising the attack, saying, \"I think Orlando, Florida, is a little safer tonight.\u201d\u00a0\nBut by and large, the shooting gave rise to an outpouring of support for the Orlando victims, coming in the form of blood donations, worldwide vigils\u00a0and fundraising efforts.In the statement, the LGBT and Muslim groups recognized the effects that both homophobia and Islamophobia have on society -- something many queer Muslims have pointed out since the shooting.\n\"We are reminded that as our communities stand together, we are in fact one community -- which includes LGBTQ Latinos and LGBTQ Muslims, who are targeted both as Muslims and as members of the LGBTQ community,\" the statement read.\u00a0\n\"Now is the time for people of all faiths, sexual orientations, gender identities, and backgrounds, to come together and refuse to allow this tragic act of violence and hate to divide us.\"", "title": "Outpouring Of LGBT, Muslim Groups Sign Statement Against Bigotry"}
