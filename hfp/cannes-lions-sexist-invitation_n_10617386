Unfortunately, we live in a world where that's not always possible.\nTuesday, some participants in the Cannes Lions international advertising festival received a party invitation stipulating that only \u201cattractive females and models\u201d were welcome. The invitation was for The Wednesday Party, sponsored by Thrillist Media Group and digital agency VaynerMedia, AdWeek reports.\nPotential female guests were asked to send \u201crecent untouched photos\u201d or links to social media for review.\nSomeone forwarded the email to advertising consultant and women\u2019s advocate Cindy Gallop, who made it pretty clear on Twitter how she felt about the requirements:Both VaynerMedia CEO Gary Vaynerchuk and Thrillist CEO Ben Lerer said that they had nothing to do with the invitation, which came from a third-party promoter.\n\u201cNo one at Thrillist (or Vayner for that matter) knew anything about what this vendor was doing and we are clearly appalled by it,\u201d wrote Lerer in an internal email forwarded to The Huffington Post. He also wrote they would no longer be working with the vendor and would be \u201cmore stringent\u201d in selecting who they work with going forward.Vaynerchuk said in a video response to Gallop that he was \u201cmortified\u201d by the email and was trying to find out more details about how it came to be.When HuffPost called the number listed on the invitation, we repeatedly got a busy signal. However, a Google search links the number with events company iGetin. The company\u2019s website appears to be down.\nEven so, it\u2019s still a little alarming anyone thought this was a good idea in 2016.\nLuckily, Kathy Ruiz,\u00a0creative director at ad agency NVRLND, had some helpful edits that they might want to take into consideration next time.", "title": "This Ad Party Invite Is Straight Out Of \u2018Mad Men\u2019 \u2014 And Not In A Good Way"}
