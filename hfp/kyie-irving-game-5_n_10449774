Then, he sliced between Andre Iguodola and Thompson, before spinning, drawing the foul on the latter and kissing a shot off the glass and through the net. With the ensuing free throw, the Cavaliers\u2019 lead was pushed to 10 -- and it looked as if their season was to be extended at least one more game.\nBut just for insurance, the Cleveland point guard hit another left-side banker two possessions later. And then, after nearly slipping, he regained his balance, spun on his defender\u2019s back and sunk a twister near the left elbow the subsequent play down the court. Finally, the next time he got the rock -- off a dish from LeBron James -- he promptly drilled a 26-foot right-wing trey to complete his 41-point night and put his team up 13, thereby officially sending the series back to Cleveland for a Game 6.\nThanks to the heroics of both Irving and James, who himself poured in 41 on the night, the Cavaliers were able to withstand a bombshell of a performance from the Warriors\u2019 Thompson, ultimately winning Monday\u2019s contest, 112-97.\u00a0It was the first time ever two teammates each had 40-plus points in the same NBA Finals game.\u00a0The Warriors now lead the series, 3-2.The level of difficulty involved in Irving\u2019s moves and makes became downright silly as the game went on. He spun. He scooped. He slipped and skipped his way through the key seemingly at will. While James did much of his damage from straightforward jumpers, Irving carved his way across the hardwood play after play, earning every bucket and finishing the night 17-24 from the field.\u00a0\nJames, moments after the contest ended, called Irving\u2019s performance \u201cspecial\u201d and \u201cspectacular,\u201d predicting that it will go down as one of the all-time great performances in Finals history. Irving, however, attributed his success to competing alongside a player like James -- a guy who attracts so much of the defense\u2019s attention, no matter where he is on the court, no matter who else is lighting up the scoreboard.Even as the Warriors began the evening shorthanded -- Draymond Green spent the night away from Oracle Arena, serving his one-game suspension -- they became even more so when Andrew Bogut went down with what was called a sprained knee in the second half.\u00a0Per ESPN's Marc Stein, the center will have an MRI on Tuesday, which will likely determine his status for Thursday's matchup.\nThe home team did, however, manage to start strong out of the gate, taking the lead in the contest\u2019s opening minutes, However, the first half quickly shifted into a chess game, with the clubs trading offensive acrobatics every time down the floor. In fact, the teams\u2019 combined 122 points prior to halftime was the most in a first half of a Finals contest since 1987, per ABC.\nWhile the Warriors were led by Thompson\u2019s long-range marksmanship -- the Splash Brother knocked in 6-of-8 threes for 26 points in the first 24 minutes alone -- Cleveland was spearheaded in the early going by, you guessed it, the James-Irving pairing, which combined for 43 points on 18-of-28 shooting before the break.\u00a0But the play of the first half undoubtedly went to Warriors back-up point guard Shaun Livingston. With 9:23 to go in the second period, Livingston, ball in his hands, curled around the top of the key and barreled through the paint, elevating for the one-handed jam and posterizing Cleveland\u2019s Richard Jefferson.\u00a0Nevertheless, short-staffed without Green,\u00a0the Warriors just couldn\u2019t keep up with the Cavaliers\u2019 one-three power punch, as MVP Steph Curry had another off night, shooting just 8-of-21. And even Thompson, who had a remarkable first half, couldn\u2019t maintain the pace following intermission, finishing, yes, with 37, but also ending the evening with a team-low -21 +/- rating.\nNow, we\u2019re headed back to Cleveland. The Warriors have lost consecutive games only one time this season -- last series, against the Oklahoma City Thunder. But if the Cavaliers don\u2019t want to play host to another Warriors champagne party later this week, they\u2019ll have to find a way to nab that feat, Golden State\u2019s record be damned.\nAnd if Irving and James continue to play like they did tonight -- well, Cleveland just may have a chance.", "title": "Kyrie Irving Just Played The Game Of His Life"}
