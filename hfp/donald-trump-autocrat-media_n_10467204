It happened in the United States.\nPresumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced Monday afternoon on Facebook that his campaign was revoking The Washington Post\u2019s press credentials after the paper, briefly, published a headline online that he considered unfair.\u00a0\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, better known for tracking press freedom abuses overseas, said that such an action \u201cprovides a ready made excuse for authoritarian leaders to crackdown further on independent journalists.\u201d\nThough Trump has\u00a0benefited\u00a0from excessive media attention this campaign cycle, he's simultaneously\u00a0vilified journalists\u00a0throughout and his campaign's\u00a0waged a sustained assault\u00a0on the the press.\u00a0The\u00a0\"phony and dishonest\" Post joined a media blacklist\u00a0Monday that has already included\u00a0Politico, Univision, Fusion, The Daily Beast, BuzzFeed, Mother Jones, National Review, The Des Moines Register, and The Huffington Post. Even news organizations receiving credentials for rallies must\u00a0agree to severe restrictions\u00a0on their reporting.\u00a0\nTrump's demonstrated an authoritarian streak throughout the campaign, from describing pro-Democracy activists massacred by the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square as rioters to\u00a0praising\u00a0the strength of Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose country ranks 148 out of 180 on Reporters Without Borders' press freedom index.\nIn December, Trump initially defended\u00a0Putin when MSNBC host Joe Scarborough claimed the Russian leader had killed journalists. (Dozens of journalists have been killed in Russia in recent years, though their\u00a0cases often go unresolved.)\u00a0And in May, Trump suggested Amazon chief and Post owner Jeff Bezos would face an anti-trust investigation if he's a elected president, a threat\u00a0some viewed\u00a0as right out of Putin's playbook.\u00a0\nOn Monday night, Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky also compared Trump to the Russian leader and said such infringements on the press should not happen in the U.S.\nTrump's rhetoric and actions have also\u00a0invited comparisons to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who has aggressively clamped down\u00a0on the press and whose country ranks 151 on the press freedom index. Some journalists have also\u00a0likened Trump to former Italian Prime Minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, given the former reality star's savvy use of television to fuel his political rise and tendency to bully journalists asking tough questions.\u00a0\nIn a Tuesday open letter to Trump, journalists from Univision News called his action against the Post \"unprecedented and dangerous.\"\n\"There are all too many places on earth where political figures use whatever is at their disposal to punish and silence unfavorable news coverage,\" they wrote. \"The U.S. is not one of those places.\"\nSeveral journalists and foreign policy experts on Twitter also compared Trump's broadside against the Post to the behavior of authoritarian governments.\u00a0Trump's demagoguery and strongman rhetoric have raised questions throughout the campaign about what can, or cannot, happen in the United States. Brookings Institution fellow Robert Kagan has argued\u00a0Trumpism may be a harbinger of fascism and some legal experts, alarmed by the GOP presumptive nominee's attacks on the press and judiciary, see\u00a0\"contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law.\"\u00a0\nJoel Simon, executive director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told HuffPost that Trump's tone and rhetoric, and actions of some of his supporters, \"have gotten on our radar\" this election cycle.\nCPJ has investigated\u00a0U.S.-based press freedom concerns\u00a0in the past, but Simon emphasized in a recent interview that the organization's priority is to advocate for \"journalists who are facing threats to their lives or threats to their freedom who are really in situations of imminent peril\" -- grave concerns that currently rise above not providing credentials for events. Journalists from blacklisted news outlets had been able to attend Trump events in the past by lining up with the public, though Trump's security recently kicked out a Politico reporter who entered a rally with a general admission ticket.\u00a0\n\"You don\u2019t want to make too direct a comparison because it trivializes the challenges that journalists face in those countries,\" Simon said. \"On the other hand, I do get nervous when politicians campaign so aggressively against the press because it sets the stage for, sort of softens up public opinion if you will, for policies that can be detrimental.\"\nOne key difference, Simon stressed, is that the U.S. has a legacy of institutions protecting speech, starting with the First Amendment. It's easier, he said, to turn such heated rhetoric into policy \"where there are no institutions or limited institutions that could restrain it.\u201d\nJournalist Masha Gessen, who has written critically on Putin and\u00a0left Russia in 2013 following the passing of anti-gay laws, has similarly expressed hope that U.S. institutions would serve as a bulwark against Trump's worst impulses. In a\u00a0recent Slate interview, Gessen agreed that Trump's threat against Bezos was a Putin tactic, but noted that the U.S. has much stronger institutions supporting democracy.\u00a0\n\"That\u2019s the really huge difference between Trump and Putin,\" Gessen said. \"The worst case scenario -- Trump comes to power -- I think we have to really ask the question, 'How much damage could he do to institutions in four years?'\"\nCharlotte Klein provided research assistance.\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Takes A Page From The Autocrat's Media Playbook"}
