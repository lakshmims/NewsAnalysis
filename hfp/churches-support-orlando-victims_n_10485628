There's nothing that will keep us from that,\" he said. \"It's a true expression of love. It's just to say 'This is my brother, this is my sister, these are people in need' ... we have to be there.\"\u00a0\nIn addition to Forest Lake SDA Church, many others including Metro Church, and the Florida Hospital Church have opened up their doors for loved ones to use for funerals or memorial services.\nSeveral of the places of worship are taking their generosity a step further as well. Metro Church noted in a statement that they'd also be willing to provide a Spanish-speaking minister for the service if needed, as well as grief counseling, and food for the families, among other items and services.\nAnderson's church has offered to live stream the services or memorials in the event that victims' loved ones are unable to come to Orlando. The church is also willing to refer families to local vendors and businesses that have expressed interest in helping during this time.\u00a0\nSenior Pastor Andy McDonald of the Hospital Church has offered to help with services in any way possible.\u00a0\n\"If they need clergy, if they need help to plan the service, print programs -- anything they would need to hold a funeral service we'd be happy to do that for them,\" he told HuffPost.\nAnderson added:\u00a0\"It really is about love. It's about loving people and being present with people. That's the true heart and character of our community and our city.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nH/T Orlando Sentinel\u00a0", "title": "Churches Offer To Host Free Funerals For Victims Of Orlando Shooting"}
