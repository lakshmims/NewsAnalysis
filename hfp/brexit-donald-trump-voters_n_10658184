In the long term, if the Brexit vote triggers a slowdown or sustained job losses in the United Kingdom -- as many predict -- Trump may find that he's made a fatal error.\nThe presumptive GOP presidential nominee bragged on Friday that his ideas are well-reflected in the sentiment driving the Brexit: a feeling among the English that they needed to \u201creclaim\u201d their country from immigrants (particularly Muslims) and globalization.\n\u201cI felt it was going to happen,\u201d Trump said Friday at a press conference held on his golf course in Scotland. \u201cThere are great similarities between what happened here and my campaign. People want to take their country back.\u201d\u00a0If the Brexit continues to roil markets, those words could come back to haunt Trump. The vote across the pond could serve us a perfect case study for the reality-TV star\u2019s ideas, which include deporting millions of people and banning an entire religious group from coming to the United States. These nakedly racist and nativist policies, plus the call to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d are the American equivalent of the anti-immigration mood that drove English voters to turn against Europe. \nThere was even a Trump-like character, Nigel Farage, leading the movement to leave the EU, as The Huffington Post's Marina Fang noted. A businessman-turned-politician, Farage heads the right-wing U.K. Independence party and has called Muslims a \u201cfifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us.\u201d\nOn Friday, Trump doubled down on the similarities, speaking at a press conference in Scotland.\n\u201cI really do see a parallel between what\u2019s happening in the United States and what\u2019s happening here. People want to see borders. They don\u2019t necessarily want people [coming] into their country they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d he reportedly said.\nTrump also boasted that he\u2019d profit as the British pound declined in value. \nSo far that sentiment has sent stock markets plunging, wiping out $2 trillion in value from capital markets on Friday, and potentially set us up for a summer of economic turmoil. \nThe specter of job loss hangs ominously over the U.K., particularly for 2.2 million financial workers in the country. Before the historic vote on Thursday, employers signaled that they\u2019d flee the country if it voted itself out of the Union. In April, John Cryan, the British-born chief executive of the German giant Deutsche Bank said he planned to move operations to Frankfurt, Germany\u2019s financial capital. \nGoldman Sachs, which has warned for years that leaving the EU could devastate the British financial sector, seems likely to move to Germany, too. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who threatened to quit the U.K. if it left the EU, said in a memo to staff Friday that \u201cwe may need to make changes to our European legal entity structure and the location of some roles.\u201dBrexit could spell trouble for the British tech industry, too. Startups benefit from European laws designed to create a \u201cdigital single market\u201d worth an estimated \u20ac415 billion, or about $460.8 billion.\n\u201cThis could be a new Lehman moment,\u201d one investment manager overseas told The Wall Street Journal, referring to the collapse of the investment bank in 2008 that set off the financial crisis.\u00a0 \n\u201cToday\u2019s UK referendum results on European Union (EU) membership will mean more uncertainty for businesses around the world as they navigate the complex implications,\" Mark Weinberger, global chairman and CEO of consulting firm EY, said in a statement.\u00a0\nTo be sure, already on Friday, political leaders were working to quell the chaos. Martin Schulz, president of the EU parliament, told The Guardian that EU lawyers would work to hasten the Brexit -- which could take up to two years of negotiation -- in hopes of minimizing volatility in the market.\u00a0\nIn the U.S., President Barack Obama reassured the world that America and England are still friends.\u00a0\"The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,\" Obama said in a statement. \"The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring.\"\nStill the road ahead looks pretty rough. And definitely in the short term, Trump\u2019s ideas just got a big test overseas and they failed -- here\u2019s hoping Americans are paying attention.\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Brexit Chaos Could Shock Trump Voters Back To Common Sense"}
