Hogan won a $140 million judgment against Gawker in a lawsuit after the gossip website published an excerpt from a sex tape in which he appeared.\nGawker filed for bankruptcy this month with a plan to sell itself to online publisher Ziff Davis LLC for $90 million, setting the floor for bids in a court-supervised auction scheduled to take place later this summer.\nThe committee makes sure value is maximized for creditors, and in this case will ensure the sale generates the biggest recovery possible, according to attorneys familiar with the case.\n(Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "title": "Hulk Hogan To Be Creditor In Gawker Bankruptcy"}
