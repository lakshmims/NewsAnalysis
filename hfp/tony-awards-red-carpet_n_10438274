The real star of the night, though, ended up not being a star at all. Instead, it was one very on-theme clutch.Both Bee Shaffer and Vanessa Nadal,\u00a0\"Hamilton\" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's wife, carried \"Hamilton\"-themed bespoke Edie Parker clutches emblazoned with \"A. Ham\" for Alexander Hamilton on one side, and \"A. Burr\" for his rival Aaron Burr on the other.\nSchaffer later proudly held up the cheeky purse alongside \"Hamilton\" Star Leslie Odom Jr., who won the Tony for Best Leading Actor in a Musical for playing Burr in the iconic show.As if the clutch clutches weren't enough, even Barbra Streisand, who appeared on the Tonys stage for the first time in 46 years, dressed delightfully on-theme to crown the show with its Best Musical nod.\n\"Thank god I picked the right outfit,\" she said before announcing the winner in a high-neck ruffled blouse with matching ruffled sleeves.\u00a0\u00a0Check out the rest of the Tonys red carpet winners below.\u00a0", "title": "How 'Hamilton' Won The Tonys Red Carpet, Too"}
