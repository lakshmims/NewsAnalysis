Channing Tatum is even hotter when he talks about feminism and the fight against rape culture.\nIn a Facebook live stream\u00a0on Wednesday morning with Cosmopolitan's editor-in-chief Joanna Coles, Tatum shared his thoughts on gender equality and his reactions to the recent sexual assault case of former Stanford student Brock Turner.\u00a0Turner, who was convicted on three felony sexual assault charges, was sentenced to only six months in county jail. \u00a0\nThe conversation, which took place in the South of France at\u00a0The Girls Lounge, was powerful and important. \"It\u2019s tough. I think rape culture is a very real thing,\" Tatum said in response to a question about the sexual assault epidemic on college campuses.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"I really think it\u2019s a horrible idea to let someone off because of possibly what they\u2019re gonna be capable of doing,\" he said. \"Because if you start doing that where do you end? Where does that stop? Where does that line actually quit? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right, I think he should\u2019ve been punished personally,\" adding that the lenient sentence simply\u00a0\"doesn't make any sense.\"\u00a0\nThe \"Magic Mike XXL\" actor pointed to the amount of rough sex in pornography as a factor in promoting rape culture.\u00a0\"A lot of porn out there looks like rape,\" Tatum said.\n\"There\u2019s nothing wrong with a little bit of rough and tumble [sex], if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into,\" he said. \"But I think it could go just the opposite way as well and we need to know that and these kids need to know that.\"\nTatum went on to discuss how important consent and communication is when it comes to sex:\u00a0\n\nI think we need to use education and we have to be comfortable talking about [sex]. Look I\u2019m uncomfortable talking about it and I\u2019m saying we should be comfortable talking about it. But it is, it\u2019s an awkward thing to talk about, it\u2019s an awkward thing to talk about especially probably with your kids. So how do we do that better? How do we actually come up with a plan to be able to communicate about sex and what do we need from each other and what are the lines and how do you even know where the lines are if you\u2019re not strong enough to say OK I\u2019m not comfortable with this anymore\u2026 People want from both directions and the only way to get to what you want is communication.\u00a0\n\nAnother highlight of the conversation came when an audience member asked the actor what feminism means to him in three words.\u00a0\u00a0\nTatum replied: \u201cI can do it in one: equality.\u201d\u00a0", "title": "Channing Tatum: 'Rape Culture Is A Very Real Thing'"}
