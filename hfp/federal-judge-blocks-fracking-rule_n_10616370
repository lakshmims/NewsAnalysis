The government received more than 1 million public comments\u00a0during the rule-making process.\nThe rule sets standards on well construction and wastewater storage, among other requirements.\u00a0But Skavdahl said the government's policy intentions were irrelevant to the question of what power it had to promulgate them in the first place.\n\"Congress\u2019 inability or unwillingness to pass a law desired by the executive branch does not default authority to the executive branch to act independently, regardless of whether hydraulic fracturing is good or bad for the environment or the Citizens of the United States,\" he wrote.\nThe judge had already put the rule on hold twice last year while the litigation proceeded, giving other states, industry and environmental groups a chance to pick sides in the dispute and offer their arguments as the case moved forward.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit is presently considering an appeal of one of these earlier orders, and a second appeal of Tuesday's ruling is also likely.House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has opposed the Obama administration in court on immigration and funding for the Affordable Care Act, among other issues, lauded Skavdahl for defending\u00a0\"the energy revolution from the heavy hand of big government.\"\n\"Only Congress can write laws. Agencies acting without authority from Congress is simply illegal,\"\u00a0Ryan said in a statement, while noting that fracking helped to keep energy prices low and create jobs.\nCiting the appeals process, the Department of the Interior declined to comment on the ruling but obliquely lamented the decision.\n\"While we defer more comment due to pending litigation, the BLMs modernized fracking requirements reflect today's industry practices and are aimed at ensuring adequate well control, preventing groundwater contamination, and increasing transparency about the materials used in the fracturing process,\" said a department spokesperson.\n\"It's unfortunate that implementation of the rule continues to be delayed because it prevents regulators from using 21st century standards to ensure that oil and gas operations are conducted safely and responsibly on public and tribal lands,\" the official added.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment, but Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, wrote in a White House blog\u00a0last year that the fracking rules only marked the beginning of a process that, in the end, rested with the states and the business sector.\n\"The majority of oil and gas development remains on state and private lands,\" Jewell wrote. \"So, the responsibility for developing this energy safely must now be taken up in state capitals, engineering labs, and boardrooms all across the country.\"", "title": "Federal Judge Blocks Major Fracking Rule, Calling It 'Contrary To Law'"}
