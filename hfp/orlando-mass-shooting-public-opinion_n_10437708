According to a recent poll, Americans prefer Donald Trump slightly over Hillary Clinton on issues of terrorism and gun policy. And this year\u2019s primaries drew out record-high numbers of Republicans. This is HuffPollster for Monday, June 13, 2016. \nORLANDO SHOOTING WAS THE DEADLIEST IN US HISTORY - Christopher Ingraham: \"Americans [woke up on Sunday] morning to horrific news out of Orlando, where a gunman opened fire at the Pulse nightclub, killing 50 people and injuring 53 more in what authorities are calling an act of domestic terrorism. Those figures would make this by far the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, according to a comprehensive database of these incidents compiled by Mother Jones magazine\u2026.The 50 fatalities at Pulse are considerably more than the 33 victims killed during the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, or the 28 fatalities in the Newtown, Conn., school shooting in 2012. The 53 people wounded are also more than the number wounded in any other shooting, with the exception of the Aurora theater shooting in 2012, in which 58 were injured.\" [WashPost] But will people change their minds about gun control? - Max Ehrenfreund: \"As America grapples with another mass shooting, we\u2019re certain to face questions about the country\u2019s unique gun culture and the prevalence of gun violence. There are some perhaps surprising developments \u2014 gun ownership in the United States is declining overall, for instance. But while mass killings have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years, support for gun rights is still resolute in America\u2026.Gun control, in general, has not been politically popular -- and its popularity has been declining lately....While many Americans strongly support the right to bear arms, they also support specific restrictions, such as background checks, assault weapons bans and a federal database to track guns.... Shootings don't tend to substantially affect views on gun control.\" [WashPost]\nThis is also being classified as a terrorist attack, though, which could affect opinion more - Last November\u2019s attacks in Europe provide some indication of how terrorist events can move opinion. Jennifer Merolla and Elizabeth Zechmeister, from November: \"For the past 10 years, we have researched the connection between terrorist threat and public opinion. In our book, 'Democracy at Risk,' and in our more recent work, we argue that public attitudes and evaluations shift in at least three politically relevant ways when terrorist threat is more prominent in the news\u2026.First, when terrorist threat is pronounced, individuals become less trusting of others, even their own neighbors. They express less favorable attitudes toward immigrants. In particular, they become less supportive of the rights of Arab and Muslim Americans\u2026.Second, terrorist threats help increase the public\u2019s support for certain political leaders\u2026.It projects leadership qualities onto political figures and then it weights leadership more heavily when voting on Election Day. But not all political leaders are affected in the same way. On average, leaders who are Republican, male, and have relevant national security experience tend to be viewed as more competent\u2026.A third way public opinion shifts in response to terrorism is toward support for more hawkish policies in foreign affairs and homeland security, even at the expense of civil liberties.\" [WashPost] \u00a0\nTrump has a slight edge over Clinton on terrorism and gun policy - A recent Gallup poll indicates that Trump has a slight advantage on the issues of terrorism and gun violence. Half of Americans prefer Trump over Clinton when it comes to \u201cterrorism and national security,\u201d compared to 46 percent who say Clinton would be better at handling the issue. Trump also has an edge when it comes to gun policy: 50 percent of Americans prefer him and 45 percent prefer Clinton. [Gallup]\nDONALD TRUMP IS DROPPING IN THE POLLS, BUT IT\u2019S EARLY - HuffPollster: \u201cJust a couple of weeks ago the big news was Donald Trump creeping up on \u2014 and in a couple of surveys, leading \u2014 Hillary Clinton in national general election polls. That was the result of Trump securing the title of 'presumptive Republican nominee' and most Republican voters lining up behind him. Now we\u2019re at the beginning of the opposite trend. But as with the brief Trump bump, Clinton\u2019s upward trend could be temporary. So don\u2019t get carried away and declare Trump\u2019s candidacy dead\u2026.As with all polling bumps, only time will tell whether they indicate lasting movement or just brief upticks in response to specific events. But the media is likely to hype every minor movement in the polls all summer. Don\u2019t buy in. Public opinion will remain somewhat fluid until after the conventions in late July, and could even fluctuate wildly in the fall campaign. Stick with the averages, and remember that everything can (and likely will) change.\u201d [HuffPost]\nTrump isn\u2019t winning enough white voters - Harry Enten: \u201c[D]espite all the bluster, [Trump] isn\u2019t doing any better than Romney did among white voters. According to [Nate Cohn\u2019s estimate], based on pre-election surveys, Romney beat President Obama by 17 percentage points among white voters. To win, Trump would need to improve on Romney\u2019s margin by a minimum of 5 percentage points if the electorate looked exactly the same as it did in 2012 and every other racial group voted in the same manner as it did in 2012\u2026.Trump is winning white voters by an average of 17 percentage points, matching exactly Romney\u2019s margin from four years ago. That\u2019s not good enough, especially considering that the 2016 electorate will probably be more diverse than 2012\u2019s. Trump probably needs to do even better than a 22-point lead among white voters, or he will have to pull in more minority voters than Romney did in order to win. Trump could still improve his standing among white voters enough to take the election. There\u2019s plenty of time.\" [538]\nPRIMARY TURNOUT NEARLY REACHED 2008 RECORD LEVELS - Drew DeSilver: \u201cMore than 57.6 million people, or 28.5% of estimated eligible voters, voted in the Republican and Democratic presidential primaries that all but wrapped up Tuesday \u2013 close to but not quite at the record participation level set in 2008. For a while it looked like this year\u2019s primaries, driven by high turnout on the Republican side, might eclipse the turnout record set in 2008, when 30.4% of voting-age citizens cast ballots. The GOP did indeed have the highest primary turnout since at least 1980, according to our analysis \u2013 14.8%, compared with 11% in 2008 and 9.8% in 2012. But turnout fell off markedly after Donald Trump won the May 3 Indiana primary and his two main rivals dropped out of the race\u2026.The overall Democratic turnout of 14.4% was well below the record 19.5% in 2008, but it was still the second-highest since 1988\u2019s primary season.\u201d [Pew Research]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!
