We hope that these\u00a0Daily Meditations, prayers and mindful awareness exercises can be part of bringing spirituality alive in your life.\nToday's meditation features an excerpt from a poem by revered gay Latino writer Richard Blanco. \"One Today\" was the poem Blanco read at President Obama's second inauguration, and it rings true once again as Americans are united in mourning the tragic shooting in Orlando, Florida. May we, indeed, be one today.An excerpt from \"One Today\" by Richard Blanco\nOne sun rose on us today, kindled over our shores,peeking over the Smokies, greeting the facesof the Great Lakes, spreading a simple truthacross the Great Plains, then charging across the Rockies.One light, waking up rooftops, under each one, a storytold by our silent gestures moving behind windows.\nMy face, your face, millions of faces in morning's mirrors,each one yawning to life, crescendoing into our day:pencil-yellow school buses, the rhythm of traffic lights,fruit stands: apples, limes, and oranges arrayed like rainbowsbegging our praise. Silver trucks heavy with oil or paper\u2014bricks or milk, teeming over highways alongside us,on our way to clean tables, read ledgers, or save lives\u2014to teach geometry, or ring-up groceries as my mother didfor twenty years, so I could write this poem.\nAll of us as vital as the one light we move through,the same light on blackboards with lessons for the day:equations to solve, history to question, or atoms imagined,the \"I have a dream\" we keep dreaming,or the impossible vocabulary of sorrow that won't explainthe empty desks of twenty children marked absenttoday, and forever. Many prayers, but one lightbreathing color into stained glass windows,life into the faces of bronze statues, warmthonto the steps of our museums and park benches as mothers watch children slide into the day.\nRead the rest of \"One Today\"\u00a0here.", "title": "Daily Meditation: One Today"}
