Donald Trump seemed to benefit from his extreme rhetoric after terrorist attacks in the fall, but that might not happen this time. And Hillary Clinton is gaining in the wake of securing the Democratic nomination. This is HuffPollster for Tuesday, June 14, 2016. \nAMERICANS WERE ALREADY WORRIED ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE BEFORE ORLANDO - HuffPollster: \"Last week, HuffPost conducted a survey to see how opinion on gun control had stabilized in the absence of recent high-profile mass shootings\u2026.In many ways, the survey\u2019s results look similar to those conducted directly following tragedies, although they represent a modest ebb in support for gun control since the attacks in San Bernardino, California, in December\u2026.A 52-percent majority called gun violence a very serious problem, and 48 percent wanted stricter gun laws \u2014 down 6 and 7 points since the San Bernardino shootings, respectively. Twenty-six percent said in the latest poll that the laws shouldn\u2019t be changed, while 18 percent wanted laws that were less strict. The public was almost evenly divided whether it\u2019s politically possible to pass stricter gun laws, with 39 percent saying that it is, and 36 percent that it\u2019s not. Thirty percent said that mass shootings are just a fact of life in the U.S, while 51 percent believed that the attacks can be stopped.\" [HuffPost] \u00a0\nAmericans favor stricter gun laws but are skeptical of effectiveness - Frank Newport: \"A comprehensive review of American attitudes about gun control conducted after the San Bernardino shootings in December of last year highlighted a number of major conclusions about the public's attitudes toward gun control. A majority of Americans -- 55% -- favor stricter gun control laws, higher than at several points in recent years since President Barack Obama took office and about where this attitude was during the George W. Bush years, but below earlier points -- including 78% in 1990, when the question was first asked\u2026.Large majorities of Americans support almost all proposals that deal with increased or more thorough background checks before guns can be purchased. Americans are not convinced, however, that increased background-check laws would reduce the number of mass shootings in the U.S. Gallup research has shown mixed attitudes about banning assault weapons in recent years\u2026.The large majority of Americans oppose a total ban on the possession of handguns. Americans are skeptical that gun control laws would be highly efficacious in controlling acts of gun violence and mass shootings.\" [Gallup] \u00a0REACTIONS AMONG ELECTORATE COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM LAST FALL\u2019S TERRORIST ATTACKS - Harry Enten: \"[W]e don\u2019t know how the tragedy will affect the race, and we should be careful about making too many conclusions based on the polls too soon. Trump\u2019s support rose in Republican primary polls in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino in late 2015. As my colleague Nate Silver wrote, Trump voters reacted positively to his calls for a temporary ban on any Muslims\u2019 entering the U.S. and tougher restrictions on immigration more generally\u2026. But, as Nate pointed out at the time, it\u2019s difficult to tease out exactly how much of a bounce Trump really got. Moreover, Trump\u2019s support didn\u2019t move much after the bombings in Brussels in March, which suggests the voters disposed to favor Trump due to the threat of terrorism may have already moved into his camp. That is, voters are now aware of Trump\u2019s positions, and he may not have any more ground to gain. This leads to a second point: The general election electorate is much different than a GOP primary electorate. Just because Trump gained support among Republicans after a terrorist attack doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019ll gain among voters at large\u2026.This was a mass shooting, a terrorist attack and a hate crime, making it hard to predict how the American public will react.\" [538] \u00a0\u00a0\nCLINTON\u2019S LEAD EXPANDS IN FIRST POLL AFTER SECURING THE NOMINATION - Hannah Hartig, John Lapinski and Stephanie Psyllos: \"Influence of the events of the past week is evident in the most recent NBC News|SurveyMonkey Weekly Election Tracking Poll, which shows Clinton leading Trump by 7 points, 49 percent to 42 percent\u2026.Clinton's gains over the past two weeks in the tracking poll are coming from increases in support among moderates, men and white voters. She narrowed Trump's margin among men and white voters from double digits in last week's poll to single digits this week. Clinton picked up 7 points among moderate voters this week and now leads Trump 58 percent to 33 percent among them. Trump's margin among male voters dropped from 14 points last week to 9 points this week and he now leads Clinton 51 percent to 42 percent. His 13-point margin among white voters last week also shrank to 9 points this week. White voters now favor Trump to Clinton 50 percent to 41 percent.\" [NBC] Most Americans don\u2019t view her nomination as historic - Eli Yokley: \"Hillary Clinton\u2019s achievement of becoming the first woman to secure a major party\u2019s presidential nomination is viewed by four in 10 voters as a 'historic moment' for the country, according to a new national poll by Morning Consult\u2026.Only a third (33 percent) of men said Clinton\u2019s achievement was historic, while 42 percent of women shared the view\u2026.Among other things, only 22 percent of Americans said they viewed Clinton\u2019s nomination a 'step forward' for the country, while 18 percent said it left them angry and another 30 percent said it made them frustrated. About one in 10 voters (12 percent) said Clinton is 'the most historic nominee the nation has ever had,' while 30 percent of them said her nomination was \u201cone of the most historic nominations, but not the most historic the nation has ever had.\u201d [Morning Consult] \nNotably, the question wording didn\u2019t point to her gender - The Morning Consult question's wording: \u201cAs you may know, Hillary Clinton has secured enough delegates to become the Democratic presidential nominee. Please let us know which of these short phrases or words you agree with. Please check all that apply.\u201d The option \u201cThis is an historic moment\u201d didn\u2019t mention gender either. Even though many respondents were likely aware of Clinton\u2019s status as the first female major party nominee, this question could have underestimated the historic sentiment by not prompting respondents to think about gender.\nFEW AMERICANS DISLIKE BOTH TRUMP AND CLINTON - Alan Abramowitz and John Sides: \"Yes, both Clinton and Trump have unusually high unfavorable ratings \u2014 higher than those of any major party nominee in many years. But only a minority of Americans actually dislikes both candidates. The actual majority of Americans likes one but not the other, and feels pretty strongly about it. Consider the survey conducted by the American National Election Study from Jan. 22-28\u2026.Respondents were asked to rate the candidates on a scale ranging from zero (extremely unfavorable) to 100 (extremely favorable). Hillary Clinton received an average rating of 41 degrees and Trump received an average rating of 40 degrees. Only 43 percent of respondents rated Clinton favorably (above 50) while 55 percent rated her negatively (below 50). Trump did slightly worse \u2014 40 percent of respondents rated him favorably while 57 percent rated him negatively\u2026.Moreover, even though both Clinton and Trump were viewed unfavorably overall, only a minority of respondents \u2014 23 percent \u2014 had unfavorable opinions of both. The majority of respondents, 63 percent, rated one favorably and the other unfavorably: 33 percent of respondents rated Clinton favorably and Trump unfavorably, while 30 percent rated Trump favorably and Clinton unfavorably. Only 9 percent of respondents had a favorable opinion of both. Very few respondents were indifferent between Clinton and Trump and most strongly preferred one to the other\u2026.More recent data show the same thing.\" [WashPost] \u00a0\u00a0\nHUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!
