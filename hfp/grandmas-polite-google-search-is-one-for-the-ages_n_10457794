Twitter user Ben John said he opened up his grandma's computer recently only to find her absolutely hilarious Google search.\n\"Omg opened my Nan's laptop and when she's googled something she's put 'please' and 'thank you,'\" John tweeted.\u00a0Grandma, who Metro.co.uk reports is 86-year-old May Ashworth, apparently thought being polite was just the norm.\u00a0\nThe hilarious gaffe has won grandma countless fans on social media. The tweet has been retweeted over 5,000 times and has drawn countless replies.\n\"Your nan is a treasure,\" wrote one Twitter user. \"At least she has manners,\" wrote another.\nJohn has tweeted that he still hasn't heard from Google on the matter. No word on whether or not politeness helps those algorithms!", "title": "Grandma's Polite Google Search Is One For The Ages"}
