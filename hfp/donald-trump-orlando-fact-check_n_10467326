In fact, Mateen\u2019s co-workers in 2013 reported that he boasted of having terrorist ties, and the FBI investigated and interviewed him.\nTrump said U.S. law enforcement agencies \u201chave to look at the mosques\u201d to stop terrorism. In fact, the FBI investigated Mateen again in July 2014 because he attended the same mosque as a Florida man who carried out a suicide bombing mission in Syria. As it did before, the FBI closed its investigation without action.\nThere is no evidence for Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cmany people,\u201d including neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters, saw \u201cbombs all over the floor\u201d of the apartment, but did not report it to authorities because of concerns about racial profiling.\nTrump implied that some Syrian refugees are members of ISIS because they had \u201ccell phones with ISIS flags on them.\u201d Norwegian officials found images of ISIS flags on some refugees\u2019 phones, but the head of Norway\u2019s asylum program said there may be other reasons for that \u2014 including the need to pass through areas controlled by ISIS.\nHe repeated his claim that Syrian refugees are coming into the United States with \u201cno documentation\u201d and \u201cno paperwork.\u201d Some refugees may lack documentation, but the head of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services told Congress that \u201cin general they have many, many documents.\u201d\nTrump called for a \u201cstop [to] the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States.\u201d The refugee crisis in Syria caused by the Islamic State has displaced nearly 5 million Syrians. Under Obama, the U.S. has accepted about 6,000 Syrian refugees \u2014 which represents 1.2 percent of all refugees who have been placed in the U.S.\u00a0during that time.\nAnalysis\nTrump, the presumptive Republican nominee, addressed the June 12 shooting in a speech in New Hampshire and on several TV shows a day after the attack in Orlando. Omar Mateen, who was born in New York and lived in Florida, killed 49 people and injured 53 others. Mateen, who pledged allegiance to the terrorist group the Islamic State, was killed at the scene.\nTrump reiterated his calls for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., and a halt to accepting Syrian refugees. He also broadly accused \u201cthe Muslim community\u201d in the U.S. of being complicit in the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando without any evidence.\u00a0The Dec. 2, 2015,\u00a0shooting in San Bernardino\u00a0was carried out by Syed Rizwan Farook, who was born in the United States, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, who came to the U.S. from Pakistan in July 2014. Fourteen people were killed.\u00a0\nFBI Investigates Mateen\u00a0\nOn CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Trump said that the U.S. needs to \u201cstop people from coming in from Syria.\u201d CNN\u2019s Christine Romans asked Trump what the shooting has to do with Syrian refugees, and Trump responded by saying he was concerned that \u201cthe Muslim community does not report people like this.\u201d\n\nRomans, June 13: But how do you equate what happened here with what \u2014 with a Syrian refugee?\nTrump: OK. This is the case of surveillance. This is the case of intelligence gathering, information. You will find that many people that knew him felt that he was a whack job, he was going \u2014 something like this would have happened. I already hear it starting to happen of people that knew him, the ex-wife and other people.\u00a0They don\u2019t report them. For some reason, the Muslim community does not report people like this.\n\nTrump said something similar in his afternoon speech.\n\nTrump, June 13:\u00a0But the Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what\u2019s going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn\u2019t turn \u2019em in, and we had death and destruction.\n\nAnd later that night in an interview on Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d with Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\nO\u2019Reilly, June 13:\u00a0Do you believe Muslim Americans fear you a little bit?\nTrump:\u00a0I hope not. I want to straighten things out. But it\u2019s so important that they \u2014 and they\u2019re tremendous people \u2014 it\u2019s so important that when they see trouble going on, like they did in San Bernardino. I mean, there were numerous people that saw bombs all over this apartment floor, they knew something was going on. They never reported him or her. They never reported and that 14 people were killed and many, many people injured. Same thing here, you\u2019re going to find out with this savage that did this horrible thing over the weekend that many people said, \u201cOh, I knew that was going to happen.\u201d They have got to report him. Because the Muslims are the ones that see what\u2019s going on. The Muslims are the ones that have to report him. And if they don\u2019t report him, then they there have to be consequences to them.\n\nLet\u2019s set aside for now what happened in San Bernardino and focus on Orlando.\u00a0There is no evidence to date that anyone, other than possibly Mateen\u2019s wife, Noor Zahi Salman, had any prior knowledge of the Orlando attack. Other people who knew Mateen was a \u201cwhack job\u201d did report him, and the FBI opened a 10-month investigation.\nFBI Director James Comey said at a June 13 midday press conference\u00a0that his agency became aware of Mateen in May 2013. At the time, Mateen was working as a security guard at a local court house, and he made some \u201cinflammatory and contradictory\u201d claims about having terrorist ties that concerned his co-workers, Comey said. He told co-workers that he had family connections to al Qaeda and that he was a member of Hezbollah, two organizations that are at odds with each other, Comey said.\n\u201cWhen this was reported to us the FBI\u2019s Miami office opened a preliminary investigation,\u201d Comey said.\nAs the New York Times reported on June 12, the FBI interviewed Mateen twice \u2014 which Comey confirmed at his press conference \u2014 \u201cbut after surveillance, records checks and witness interviews, agents were unable to verify any terrorist links and closed their investigation.\u201d Comey said the investigation lasted 10 months.\nSo the people who knew that Mateen was, in Trump\u2019s words, \u201ca whack job\u201d did report him, and there is no evidence to date that \u201cthe Muslim community\u201d at large knew of Mateen\u2019s horrific plans. NBC News and others reported a day after Trump\u2019s speech that Mateen\u2019s wife, Noor Zahi Salman, may have known about her husband\u2019s plans. She may face criminal charges, NBC News reported.\nIn the CNN interview, Trump also said U.S. law enforcement agencies \u201chave to look at the mosques\u201d to stop terrorism. \u201cWe have to look at the mosques,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look at all \u2014 we have to look at the community.\u00a0And believe me, the community knows the people that have potential for blow up.\u201d\nIn this case, the FBI did \u201clook at the mosques,\u201d as Trump put it.\nAt his press conference, Comey said that the FBI opened a second investigation of Mateen in July 2014 because he attended the same mosque as Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, a Florida man who carried out a suicide bombing mission in Syria. Comey said Abu-Salha knew Mateen \u201ccasually from attending the same mosque in that area of Florida.\u201d He said the FBI again interviewed Mateen. \u201cBut our investigation turned up no ties of any consequence between the two of them,\u201d Comey said.\nSo Trump\u2019s call for law enforcement to \u201clook at the mosques\u201d is something that actually happened in Mateen\u2019s case.\nSan Bernardino Shooters\nThere is also no evidence for Trump\u2019s repeated claim that \u201cmany people\u201d including neighbors of the San Bernardino shooters saw \u201cbombs all over the floor\u201d of the apartment, but did not report it to authorities because of politically correct concerns about racial profiling.\nOne friend of a neighbor said the neighbor noticed a lot of packages arriving at the home of the San Bernardino shooters,\u00a0Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, and that they were doing a lot of work in their garage. The friend said the neighbor did not report it because she did not want to racially profile the couple. And a worker in the neighborhood reported seeing a half dozen well-dressed Middle Eastern men walking from the home to a nearby lunch spot on several occasions, which the man said he found unusual but did not report.\nIn neither case did anyone report that they had seen \u201cbombs all over the floor\u201d of the couple\u2019s home, and failed to report it to authorities.\nTrump debuted the unsubstantiated claim several months ago, and he has begun to repeat it again in the wake of the Orlando shooting, making the case that neighbors, and particularly those in the Muslim community, must have been aware of the danger of people like the Orlando shooter, but remained silent, just as he claims they did in San Bernardino.\nTrump first repeated the claim on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on June 13 (at the 6:07 mark):\n\nTrump, June 13:\u00a0Like in the case of San Bernardino, there were bombs all over the floor. Many people saw the bombs. Those bombs weren\u2019t there as play toys. And they could have been reported long before San Bernardino took effect. Nobody\u2019s reporting these people.\n\nHe made a similar point in his speech that afternoon:\n\nTrump:\u00a0In San Bernardino, as an example, people who know what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it. They said, \u201cOh we thought so but we didn\u2019t want to use racial profiling,\u201d which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer so they don\u2019t get in trouble.\n\nTrump reiterated the claim in three other interviews that day, on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d and later in an interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox News.\n\nTrump, \u201cGood Morning America\u201d:\u00a0We have to get the people that surround these maniacs to start talking. People know when they\u2019re sickos, I mean for the large part like in San Bernardino with the bombs all over the apartment. People saw those bombs nobody reported them.\nTrump, \u201cNew Day\u201d:\u00a0In San Bernardino, there were bombs all over the apartment floor. In other cases, they knew when they went to interview \u2014 and you\u2019re going to find that with this madman. People in the area, the people in the neighborhood, they know there\u2019s something off with him, and they don\u2019t report them to the police. They don\u2019t report them to the FBI.\nTrump, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d:\u00a0It\u2019s so important that when they see trouble going on, like they did in San Bernardino. I mean, there were numerous people who saw bombs all over this apartment floor, they knew something was going on. They never reported him or her.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claim, there is no evidence that any neighbors saw \u201cbombs all over the floor\u201d but declined to report it due to political correctness and not wanting to seem as though they were racially profiling.\nAuthorities did find what the Los Angeles Times described as \u201can armory of weapons and explosives \u2026 including a dozen pipe bombs and thousands of rounds of ammunition\u201d in the Redlands home of the couple responsible for the shooting rampage that left 14 dead. But there is no evidence so far that any neighbors knew about that cache of explosives.\nOn the day of the shooting on Dec. 2, 2015,\u00a0CBS Los Angeles aired an interview with a \u201cman who worked in the neighborhood the past three months\u201d who \u201csaid he noticed unusual activity.\u201d But the extent of the \u201cunusual activity\u201d reported by the man \u2014 who was not identified in the news report \u2014 was that he noticed six well-dressed \u201cMiddle Eastern guys\u201d walk from the home to a nearby lunch spot on several occasions. The man said he and his co-workers wondered, \u201cWhat are those guys doing in this neighborhood?\u201d\nOn Dec. 3, 2015, Los Angeles\u2019\u00a0KTLA 5\u00a0aired an interview with a man, Aaron Elswick, who is a friend of one of the neighbors. Elswick said the neighbor told him she noticed, \u201cThey were receiving quite a number of packages and they were also working a lot in their garage.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it sounds like she didn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Elswick said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to do any kind of racial profiling.\u201d\nNeither of those reported cases includes someone who saw bombs on the floor of the home.\nA friend and former neighbor of Syed Farook,\u00a0Enrique Marquez Jr., is accused of providing Farook with two of the rifles used in the shooting. Marquez has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and lying about the rifle purchases. According to the affidavit in the criminal complaint against him, Marquez \u2014 who has pleaded not guilty \u2014 said he was introduced to Islam by Farook, and that he converted to the religion in 2007. Marquez said Farook then introduced him to radical Islamic ideology, and in 2011 the two subsequently discussed and planned an attack at Riverside Community College. The attack never happened, though, and Marquez told investigators that in recent years he had tried to distance himself from Farook.\n\u201cProsecutors have said there is no evidence Marquez had any knowledge of the San Bernardino attack before it happened,\u201d the Washington Post reported earlier this month.\nDuring the fifth Republican debate in mid-December, Trump accused the mother of the San Bernardino shooter of having advance knowledge of her son\u2019s plans. \u201cYou take a look at just the attack in California the other day,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere were numerous people, including the mother, that knew what was going on.\u201d\nWe noted then that the FBI was investigating what \u2014 if anything \u2014 the mother of Syed Farook, Rafia Farook, knew prior to the mass shooting on Dec. 2.\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at very, very closely,\u201d U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Dec. 6, 2015. But she also said, \u201cI can\u2019t characterize the knowledge of any of the other witnesses in the case.\u201d\nNBC has reported that the mother lived in the same house where her son and his wife were building pipe bombs and stockpiling ammunition. The London Daily Mail later reported that FBI agents found shooting targets inside a car owned by the mother.\nBut so far officials have not brought any charges or made any accusation against the mother, whose lawyer says that his client didn\u2019t know what her son was planning.\nWe reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign for clarification about who the \u201cmany people\u201d were who saw bombs in the home of the San Bernardino shooters and \u201cknew exactly what was going on\u201d but refused to report that to authorities. We did not get a response.Syrian Refugees & ISIS Flags\nTrump also used his speech and interviews to call on the U.S. to stop accepting Syrian refugees.\nThe civil war that broke out in Syria in March 2011 so far has displaced nearly 5 million Syrian people, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Obama administration plans to accept as many as 10,000 during this fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, 2016.\nIn an interview with George Stephanopoulos on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d Trump warned about the dangers of accepting Syrian refugees and cited as evidence that\u00a0\u201csome of them have cell phones with ISIS flags on them.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos, June 13: But, sir, let me interrupt you on that one right there. How would the ban have made a difference here? This man was a United States citizen. He was born in New York. He lived in Florida.\nTrump: No, that\u2019s right. But we have many people coming in whose hate is equal to his and \u2014 just as bad \u2014 and even worse, frankly. And we have stop people from coming in, we have no documentation. We don\u2019t know where they come from. They could be ISIS.\u00a0In fact, some of them have cell phones with ISIS flags on them. We are taking in people and it\u2019s getting worse.\n\nWe will get to Trump\u2019s misleading claim that Syrian refugees have \u201cno documentation\u201d later. But first let\u2019s take his muddled claim about Syrian cell phones and the ISIS flags.\nTrump didn\u2019t make it clear \u2014 and Stephanopoulos didn\u2019t ask him about it \u2014 but Trump was not talking about Syrian refugees in the U.S. He is referring to a report that Norwegian officials found images of ISIS flags on some refugees\u2019 phones. However, Trump neglected to mention that the report also quoted the head of Norway\u2019s asylum program saying that there may be other explanations for the images, including the need for refugees to pass through areas controlled by ISIS.\nHere\u2019s what happened: As part of the asylum registration and review process, Norwegian officials checked the cell phones and luggage of Syrians seeking asylum and found some images of ISIS flags and disturbing photos, as was reported about six months ago by Nettavisen, an online Norwegian news site.\n\u201cAmong these findings should have been photos and videos of executions and brutal punishments, such as photos of people holding up severed heads or hands,\u201d Nettavisen wrote, according to a\u00a0Google translation of the article. \u201cIt should also have been found images of dead children and other victims of war, crimes or terrorism. It has also been found flags, symbols and characters that can be linked to the terrorist group IS, as well as other terrorist groups.\u201d\nInfowars, a conservative website in the U.S., and the British tabloid the Daily Mail\u00a0both ran stories on Dec. 14, 2015, about Nettavisen\u2019s report, and Trump the next day made reference to it at a Republican primary debate.\nBut Infowars in its report ignored the possible explanations for these images, and so did Trump. Nettavisen wrote that Erik Haugland, who is identified as \u201cthe head of the asylum responsibility,\u201d said the images may not be as alarming as they seem.\n\nNettavisen: There may be several reasons why you have such images. One can be a witness and have a desire to show what you\u2019ve seen, or you may have been tactically and have symbols associated with organizations that control areas passing through. What looks alarmingly out, may have other explanations than support to terrorist organizations, he says to the newspaper.\n\nNettavisen wrote an article after the GOP debate about Trump\u2019s reference to its story. In that article, the Norwegian news site noted that Trump did not include the possible reasons for asylum-seekers carrying such images on their cell phones.\nScreening Refugees\nIn his New Hampshire speech, and in a subsequent interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump also falsely claimed Clinton wanted to increase the number of Syrian refugees \u201cwithout a screening plan,\u201d and exaggerated when he claimed that the refugees have \u201cno paperwork\u201d and \u201cno documentation.\u201d\n\nTrump, New Hampshire:\u00a0Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country.\nTrump, \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d:\u00a0Because she doesn\u2019t know who is coming in. There is no paperwork. There is no documentation.\n\nIn fact,\u00a0Clinton has stressed the need for screening refugees. At a Democratic debate in November, Clinton explained that the U.S. should increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted \u201conly\u201d if there is a \u201ccareful\u201d screening process.\n\nClinton, Nov. 14, 2015: I also said that we should take increased numbers of refugees. The administration originally said 10[thousand]. I said we should go to 65[thousand], but only if we have as careful a screening and vetting process as we can imagine, whatever resources it takes because I do not want us to, in any way, inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country.\n\nThe current process for admitting a refugee to the U.S. is very lengthy.\nFirst, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or sometimes a U.S. embassy, refers a qualified refugee for resettlement in the U.S. After that, there\u2019s an initial multistep security clearance, including the collection of the refugee\u2019s personal data and background information. That is followed by an in-person interview abroad with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which has to approve the application. The security clearance involves checking the refugee\u2019s name and fingerprints against several government databases. That\u2019s followed by a medical screening and a pairing with one of the voluntary agencies in the U.S. that sponsors refugees. And, finally, there\u2019s another security clearance, to check for any new information, to complete the process.\nAccording to the State Department, on average, the process, from the UNHCR referral to finally being admitted into the U.S., takes 18 to 24 months.\nAnd while it may be the case that some Syrian refugees lack the documentation necessary to identify them, that is not the case for everyone.\nWhen Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions raised a similar concern last year at a\u00a0Senate subcommittee hearing on refugee resettlement, Barbara Strack, chief of the refugee affairs division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said that Syrian refugees tend to have \u201cmany, many documents.\u201d\n\nSessions, Oct. 1, 2015: And what if they don\u2019t have any documents? A lot of people don\u2019t have any documents. What do you refer to then?\nStrack: In general, again, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve found with Syrian refugees \u2026 in general they have many, many documents. We involve the law enforcement community, intelligence community. We invite them in to train our refugee officers and to talk to them about country conditions information.\nSo if someone doesn\u2019t have documents, for example, they might tell us, \u201cMy documents were destroyed when a barrel bomb fell on my house.\u201d We\u2019ll ask when and where that happened, and then we can check with intelligence community, or often even open-source information, to find out if that\u2019s realistic. Was that happening at that place at that time?\nSo we have a multifaceted approach to this.\n\nThat point was also emphasized by a \u201csenior administration official\u201d during a background briefing on the refugee screening process by the State Department in November.\n\nSenior Administration Official Two, Nov. 17, 2015: I mean, there\u2019s been also, I know, quite a bit of talk about whether refugees have or don\u2019t have documents. We really \u2014 our experience worldwide covers the gamut. There are refugee populations who have very minimal documents. Maybe people have been living in refugee camps for generations, or people who fled in a way that they \u2014 they \u2014 their documents were destroyed or they were stolen or taken from them as they travel.\nI would say in contrast to that, Iraqis and Syrians tend to be a very, very heavily documented population. And members of families tend to have passports and family registries and military books, and they have a lot of information in most instances. And people who are interviewing them from their first time they register with UNHCR, going through the administrative form-filling process and then coming for their refugee interview, are pretty familiar with the kinds of documents that various populations have, and are pretty sophisticated about what they should see, and if something\u2019s missing, why is it missing. That would be a line of questioning.\n\nOther officials have voiced concerns about the vetting of Syrian refugees.\nMichael Steinbach, who last year was the FBI assistant director for counterterrorism, said that unreliable information from Syria could make the screening process difficult.\n\u201cYou have to have information to vet, so the concern in Syria is that we don\u2019t have systems in places on the ground to collect the information to vet,\u201d Steinbach said at a February 2015 hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee. \u201cDatabases don\u2019t hold the information on those individuals, and that\u2019s the concern.\u201d\nAnd FBI Director James Comey, at a\u00a0House Judiciary Committee hearing on Oct. 22, 2015, said that \u201cwe have improved dramatically our ability as an interagency \u2014 all parts of the U.S. government \u2014 to query and check people.\u201d But even he said that \u201cour ability to touch data with respect to people who may come from Syria, may be limited.\u201d\nThat said, it\u2019s false for Trump to declare that there is \u201cno paperwork\u201d and \u201cno documentation\u201d for refugees coming from Syria. Syrian refugees often have a lot of documentation, as government officials have stated.\nSyrian Refugees in the U.S.\nIn his speech, Trump also referred to \u201cthe tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States.\u201d\u00a0Of course, Trump wants to stop all Syrian refugees from entering the U.S., and he is entitled to that opinion.\u00a0But let\u2019s look at the facts.\nAs we stated earlier, there are about 5 million Syrian refugees, and the Obama administration has agreed to accept up to 10,000 in fiscal year 2016, which ends on Sept. 30. As we already noted, the process to screen and resettle refugees takes up to two years.\u00a0As of June 13, the United States under Obama has accepted a total of 5,954 Syrian refugees\u00a0in eight years \u2014 most of them in 2015 and 2016, as the administration responded to the international crisis. That\u2019s a fraction of the millions of Syrian refugees worldwide.\nIt is also a small percentage \u2014 1.2 percent \u2014 of the 503,205 refugees who have been placed in the U.S. in the past eight years.\nIt is also worth noting that the vast majority of the Syrian refugees are women and children, according to the State Department\u2019s\u00a0Refugee Processing Center. Of the 5,954 Syrian refugees that have come to the United States, 2,838 were females of all ages and 1,406 were boys under the age of 14. That means that 71 percent were women and children under 14.", "title": "Donald Trump Distorted Lots Of Facts When Speaking About The Orlando Shooting"}
