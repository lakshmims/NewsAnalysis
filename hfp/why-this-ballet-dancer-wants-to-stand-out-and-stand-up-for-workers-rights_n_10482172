It could be that he\u2019s tall, a head and shoulders above some of his colleagues at the\u00a0Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. It could be his remarkably expressive face or the way he slinks when he walks, even when he\u2019s just going to the side of the room to grab a sip from his water bottle.\nIt could be that Carmon stands out because he\u2019s decided that he doesn\u2019t want to fit in.\nCarmon, 28, says that Ailey is the only company he ever wanted to join -- but that, for a long time, he didn\u2019t want to dance with a company at all. He didn\u2019t want to spend years of his dance career \"in the back of a corps waving a rose back and forth.\" (And yes, \u201cCenter Stage\u201d fans, he did use that exact quote in his interview with The Huffington Post.) In ballet, the measure of a good corps de ballet is often sameness: Is everyone dancing perfectly in sync? Is your arabesque exactly as high as everyone else\u2019s? That didn\u2019t sound like Carmon\u2019s idea of a good time.\nCarmon grew up gay in Beaumont, Texas, with a mother who is a devout Southern Baptist. He didn\u2019t start taking ballet classes until he was 18, because he didn\u2019t want to wear tights. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people staring at me,\u201d he said.\nA decade later, he doesn\u2019t mind people looking at him, whether he\u2019s in tights or drag or nothing at all. He is dancing in the corps, but Ailey\u2019s corps, he explains, is a place where he doesn\u2019t have to look or move exactly like everyone else. It\u2019s the kind of company where magnetic stage presence like his -- the kind that landed him a role in a Tony-Award-winning musical -- is welcomed.Perhaps it\u2019s for that reason that Carmon, once so averse to joining a company, has become deeply invested in sticking up for the rights of his fellow dancers.\nAt a recent Friday rehearsal in Ailey\u2019s giant building in Hell\u2019s Kitchen, New York, there are 14 dancers in the studio, all of them men, all but two of them black. Carmon is the willowiest of them, the longest-limbed, the most mobile in the hips -- no small achievement in a room full of professionally flexible people.\nIn Adidas sweats and sneakers and a red-and-white raglan T-shirt with the company\u2019s name on it, he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s dressed for a dance rehearsal, but the men around him are all dressed similarly as Artistic Director Robert Battle calls them into the center of the room to begin. \"The Hunt\" is a piece Battle choreographed: a dance for six men that conveys a kind of aggressive and violent masculinity you don\u2019t usually associate with ballet.\nThe men throw themselves onto the ground, pound their feet into the floor, bare their teeth, and drag one another across the floor. It\u2019s a punishing piece, set to loud drumming that\u2019s occasionally punctuated by spontaneous grunting, which Battle encourages. During a much-needed break, as the men pant and peel off sweaty shirts, he explains how the dance got its title. Battle was half-watching television one exhausted night when, flipping through the channels, he landed on a show in which a man was talking about his strategy for picking up women in the club, which involved wearing a certain scent and \"picking your target and finding its Achilles\u2019 heel.\" The dancers nod, in amusement or discomfort, or both, as Battle talks. \u201cHe said, \u2018I call it The Hunt.'\u201dThe floor, as it happens, is an essential part of this dance, and this company. Dancers rehearse and perform on a vinyl mat called marley, which prevents them from slipping, and that\u2019s laid over sprung floor to minimize the damage that landing jumps and, in this case, stomping and sprawling on the ground, does to bones and tendons. As dancers, it\u2019s one of the few pieces of equipment they have onstage with them: shoes, costume, floor. That\u2019s it.\nAnd as a union delegate, part of Carmon\u2019s job is to make sure that the third part of the equation is always there. \u201cPeople who came before us have fought really hard to make sure that the standards are a certain way,\u201d Carmon told HuffPost. \u201cWe tour with our floors, our sprung floors. We need certain marley to protect the dancers\u2019 bodies.\u201d\nThat means that wherever the company goes, whether it\u2019s Louisville or London, the floor comes with them. That\u2019s been the case for well over a decade. \u201cThe dancers fought for it,\u201d Carmon told HuffPost. \u201cThey said, \u2018OK, well, if we don\u2019t have this, then we can\u2019t perform. We\u2019re not going to perform.\u2019 And it was almost like a strike situation.\u201d\nA few years into Carmon\u2019s time at the company, on tour in Oslo, dancers started complaining of injuries, and began to suspect that the floor they were dancing on was not, in fact, the marley they were used to -- and they turned out to be right. Their transportable home turf had not, in fact, made the trip to Norway.\nThe individuals who were acting as delegates at the time had a meeting with their fellow dancers to explain how hard the fight to secure the floor had been.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We understand that some of you may not feel comfortable voicing your opinions and speaking out, but if we ask you to stand in solidarity with us, then we need to know that you\u2019re going to do that.' Because if they have even one dancer that says, \u2018Oh, I can do it,\u2019 they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Well, why can\u2019t everyone else?'\"\nCarmon finds the work of being a delegate taxing and thankless. \"Frankly, it\u2019s not nearly enough pay for the amount of work we do,\" he told HuffPost.\u00a0But it's also vital. Because their work is so hard on the body, dancers have short careers as it is; most of them stop performing professionally before they hit 40.Carmon started dancing at 13 years old, and his body has already sustained significant wear and tear, which is exacerbated by the fact that his feet aren\u2019t built for dancing. He has low arches and his feet roll inward, the exact opposite of what\u2019s required for classical and contemporary ballet. \u201cI am constantly in pain,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned just to cope with, because these are the feet I have.\u201d\nStill, doctors have told him to be ready for his feet -- his already stretched-out ligaments -- to end his dancing career.\n\u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018When these go, that\u2019s gonna be it for you, and no one wants to say this, but you should be prepared for that.'\"\u00a0Since a doctor told him that, three or four years ago, Carmon hasn\u2019t taken a vacation.\u00a0He\u2019s been preparing for the inevitable end of his dancing days. He teaches workshops around the country and choreographs dances for competitions.\n\u201cPeople ask me why I don\u2019t take time off ... in my time off, I schedule classes. I schedule choreography. I\u2019m always traveling.\"\u00a0\nHis feet, he said, are his own personal motivation to make sure he\u2019ll still have a career in dance even when he can\u2019t dance anymore, to ensure that he has something to fall back on.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very aware of the fact that this is not going to last forever,\" Carmon told HuffPost.\u00a0And in the meantime, he\u2019s looking out for his fellow dancers, and making sure they have the right ground beneath their feet.\nIn this series, The Huffington Post profiles some of the best ballet dancers in the world, working in some of the rarest and most unusual work environments imaginable, to try to understand how they deal with the same workplace issues that confront the rest of us mere mortals.\nMost of us don\u2019t get literal standing ovations from hundreds of people when we do good work. And most of us don\u2019t have to visit the physical therapist at the beginning and end of every work day. But no matter what sector we\u2019re in, the big questions are the same:\nWhat does it mean to have your body under scrutiny on the job?
