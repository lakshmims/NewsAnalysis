He believed it was important to bring up his own struggles in life in order to connect with the campers and make sure that his message resonated with them.\n\nEquating sexual violence with a minor \"shoplifting citation\" is slap in the face to the heinousness of sexual violence. And later in the profile, Kennedy devotes an entire paragraph to an anecdote about Winston shooting squirrels with a BB gun. More space is dedicated to the life of a squirrel than the life of the woman who says Winston raped her.\u00a0\nIn December 2012,\u00a0Winston was accused of raping then-FSU student\u00a0Erica Kinsman. Kinsman reported the alleged assault to local Tallahassee law enforcement, who sat on the accusations for 10 months and, according to Kinsman and the prosecutor,\u00a0seriously mismanaged the case.\u00a0\nKinsman\u00a0sued FSU, accusing the university of protecting a star athlete instead of investigating the alleged rape, as university officials are obligated to do under Title IX. Because of this lawsuit, the university also faced a federal investigation.\u00a0Earlier this year, FSU announced that it would make a $950,000 settlement in Kinsman's case. Kinsman and Winston have also sued each other, and those cases are ongoing.\nAmidst the tangled web of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits (during which an alleged rapist received a\u00a0multi-million dollar paycheck from the NFL), The New York Times found in their report of Winston's investigation that ultimately \"there was virtually no investigation at all, either by the police or the university.\"\nThe New York Times' Walt Bogdanich wrote in 2014:\u00a0\n\nThe police did not follow the obvious leads that would have quickly identified the suspect as well as witnesses, one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter. After the accuser identified Mr. Winston as her assailant, the police did not even attempt to interview him for nearly two weeks and never obtained his DNA.\nThe detective handling the case waited two months to write his first report and then prematurely suspended his inquiry without informing the accuser. By the time the prosecutor got the case, important evidence had disappeared, including the video of the sexual act.\n\nNone of this was mentioned in The Undefeated's 1,100-word profile of Winston.\nAs Deadspin's Tom Ley pointed out, refusing to engage with the parts of Winston's story that aren't so feel-good meant that the profile became nothing more than \"a glorified press release\":\n\nIt was never meant to offer any critical analysis or frank discussion, but to gently remove words like \"rape\u201d and \u201ccover-up\u201d from conversations about Jameis Winston, and to replace them with \"football IQ\" and \"potential.\"\n\nOther journalists have been vocal in their criticism of The Undefeated profile:\u00a0Of course, The Undefeated is not the first major publication to emphasize an alleged sexual abuser's athletic career at the cost of overlooking his violent assault on a woman.\u00a0\nIt happened with the coverage of\u00a0Brock Turner.\nAnd\u00a0Daniel Holtzclaw.\nAnd\u00a0Owen Labrie.\nAnd\u00a0Jack Montague.\nThe trope of the promising athlete who valiantly overcomes adversity in the form of a rape allegation is so common that it became an Onion video half a decade ago. But when\u00a0satire\u00a0feels so close to real life, it's hard to laugh.", "title": "Pro Athlete Gets Glossy Media Treatment Despite Rape Allegation"}
