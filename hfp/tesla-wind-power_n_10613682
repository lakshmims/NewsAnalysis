Last year, the company released the Powerwall, a standalone battery system based on that same technology. The Powerwall enables everyone from individual homeowners to utility companies to store excess energy produced when the sun is out or wind is blowing. Tesla, which partnered with SolarCity for to launch the Powerwall, has marketed the product as an ideal add-on to a home solar system, but the devices work just as well with any other electricity source, including wind turbines.\u00a0\nWind and solar power have both gotten cheaper in recent years, and the trend will continue over the next several decades, according to\u00a0a recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF). Solar and wind will be the \"cheapest ways to produce electricity\" for most of the world by the time we reach the 2030s, the report says.\nMeanwhile, BNEF says new investment in clean energy has climbed in America over the last decade, with solar energy edging out wind in the past couple of years.Major corporations like Apple and Google have invested heavily in solar energy. While solar and wind are both cost-effective ways to generate power, wind has a number of unique challenges: Turbines are noisy and can disrupt or even harm wildlife, and they generally need to be built at remote locations far from the urban centers where energy is needed.\nNot that location isn't a concern for green energy generally. Unlike drums of oil, trainloads of coal or tankers of gas, it\u2019s difficult to move solar or wind energy from place to place. Tesla is betting big that its lithium-ion packs can do the trick, and has invested billions to build the world\u2019s biggest battery factory in Nevada. The so-called Gigafactory is slated to begin production next year.\n\u201cWind, I think, will be part of the equation,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I think the wind companies are doing fine, and where wind is applicable they seem to be doing a good job of generating that.\u201d\nOnce the Gigafactory goes live, Musk said he hopes to leverage the company\u2019s manufacturing muscle to increase and streamline production for existing products by Tesla and, if the merger is approved by shareholders, SolarCity.\n\u201cThere are benefits to sharing knowledge, assuming we\u2019re going to be a combined company, on the manufacturing front and scaling up production and figuring out how to build the machine that builds the machine,\u201d Musk said. \u201cTesla is hellbent on becoming the best manufacturer in the world.\u201d ", "title": "Why Elon Musk Is Betting On Solar Power Instead Of Wind"}
