Following a public outcry after the purge was uncovered in April ahead of the Democratic primary, officials categorized it as routine maintenance inexplicably gone awry.\nNow, according to data published Tuesday\u00a0by WNYC, it seems the \"routine maintenance\"\u00a0disproportionately affected Hispanics, with voters in predominantly Hispanic districts purged from the election rolls 60 percent more often than anyone else.\nPer the WNYC investigation, 13.9 percent of voters in predominantly Hispanic districts saw their names removed from the rolls, while in all other districts, the purge affected just 8.7 percent of voters.\nThe purge and WNYC's findings have raised some concerns about voter suppression, spurring action from elected Democrats.\u00a0New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced in April that he was\u00a0opening an investigation into the city Board of Elections over the matter, as did city Comptroller Scott Stringer, who said he planned to audit the board.\nRep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez (D-N.Y.), who represents the 7th District -- which had the highest percentage of purged voters -- told WNYC she intends to verify the findings and alert the Department of Justice.\n\"I do not want to think that it was deliberate, you know, because that would be voter suppression, and at a time when the Voting Rights Act is under attack in Washington, to have this type of action in a city and state like New York, a Democratic city, it\u2019s just beyond any comprehension,\u201d she said.\nIn a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday, Vel\u00e1zquez asked for federal election monitors to oversee next week's congressional primary there on June 28. \"The sheer volume of purged voters in the 7th congressional district is staggering and incomprehensible,\" she wrote.\nBoard of Elections Executive Director Michael Ryan told WNYC the purged voters will be reinstated ahead of the primary. Two officials who served on the board and were behind the decision have been suspended without pay.", "title": "Hispanics Were More Likely To Be Scratched In Brooklyn Voter Purge"}
