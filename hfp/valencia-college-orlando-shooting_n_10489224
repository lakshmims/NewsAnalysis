We join their families and friends in mourning the loss and celebrating the lives of:\n\nAmanda Alvear\nOscar A. Aracena-Montero\nCory James Connell\nMercedez Marisol Flores\nJuan Ramon Guerrero\nJason Benjamin Josaphat\nLuis Omar Ocasio-Capo\n\nWe hope that each of you take a moment of silence to mourn for those in our community who have been lost, but not forgotten.\n\nThe college president,\u00a0Sandy Shugart, also released a video calling on grieving students not to fill \"every moment with media flurry\" but to take time to process what happened.\u00a0\n\"Come to school here at Valencia ready to hug and support others,\" he said. The mass shooting happened during\u00a0Latin night\u00a0at a gay nightclub, and Shugart noted that some people who are Hispanic or LGBT could feel particular affinity to the victims. He urged people to support each other as they process the mass shooting.\nShugart admonished students not to attack Muslim classmates and staff simply because the killer was of the same religion.\n\"Be sure to embrace them too; they didn't cause this,\" he said.\u00a0\"This was the act of a madman, a crazy person, not a faith.\"Valencia is planning a vigil Wednesday night to honor those killed. A Facebook event page\u00a0said there would be \"speakers representing our diverse community.\"", "title": "Valencia College Mourns 7 Of Its Students Killed In Pulse Nightclub Shooting"}
