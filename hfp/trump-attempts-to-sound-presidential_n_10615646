Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) frequently leveled against Clinton during the Democratic primary.\n\"We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place,\" Trump said, before appealing directly to Sanders supporters to \"join our movement.\"\nThe speech contained few incendiary comments of the kind Trump's rallygoers have come to expect. There was no mention of building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and making Mexico pay for it, and Trump did not call for a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States. In fact, he spoke of \"peaceful Muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized [by the Islamic State], and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.\"\nHe did, on the other hand, issue an ominous warning about Clinton wanting to admit \"hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth -- with no way to screen who they are.\" In reality, refugees to the U.S. go through a rigorous vetting process.\nStill, it was a marked shift in tone from Trump's usual explosive style. And if it wasn't quite the long-promised \"pivot\" toward civility that establishment Republicans have been anxiously awaiting, it did suggest that Trump's campaign chairman -- the experienced Beltway insider Paul Manafort -- is now firmly in charge of the candidate's message following the ouster of Trump's truculent former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski.\nFor the content of the speech, Trump relied heavily on two negative books about Clinton. The first, Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweizer, delves into the perceived associations between Clinton's work as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation, which counts foreign countries among its donors.\nThe second book, Crisis in Character, was written by a former Secret Service agent and questions Clinton's temperament. However,\u00a0a number of\u00a0current and former agents have denounced the book, saying the author, Gary Byrne, was never close enough to the former first lady or her husband, former President Bill Clinton, to have seen all the things he claims.\nClinton's campaign pushed back against the Trump speech, telling NPR, \"While Hillary Clinton lays out her vision for an America that is stronger together with an economy that works for everyone and not just those at the top, Donald Trump can't help himself from rehashing and recycling more tired and old nonsense from books that already have been debunked.\"\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Trump Makes Yet Another Attempt To Sound Presidential"}
