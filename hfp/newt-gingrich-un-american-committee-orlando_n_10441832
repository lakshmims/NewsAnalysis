We're going to ultimately declare a war on Islamic supremacists and we're going to say, if you pledge allegiance to ISIS, you are a traitor and you have lost your citizenship. And we're going take much tougher positions. In the late 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt was faced with Nazi penetration in the United States. We originally created the House Un-American Activities Committee to go after Nazis. We passed several laws in 1938 and 1939 to go after Nazis and we made it illegal to help the Nazis. We're going to presently have to go take the similar steps here.\n\nThe Special Committee on Un-American Activities was formed in 1934 to investigate Nazi propaganda and organizations spreading propaganda inside the U.S. It later shifted its focus,\u00a0investigating disloyalty and subversive activities by U.S. citizens. By 1945, however, the panel was largely focused on investigating purported communist ties -- using its power to subpoena and blacklist Hollywood actors, screenwriters and directors.\u00a0It is commonly associated with Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.),\u00a0whose notorious witch hunts against purported communist agents earned him censure by the U.S. Senate.\nIn 2011, Gingrich said the committee was \"absolutely\" a good idea \"when it was created.\"\nThe gunman in the Orlando shooting was Omar Mateen, an American citizen who reportedly declared his allegiance to the Islamic State militant group\u00a0before carrying out Saturday night's massacre. Mateen was killed by a SWAT team. President Barack Obama has said there's no clear evidence that Mateen was acting as part of a larger terrorist network.\nThe mass shooting, the deadliest in U.S. history,\u00a0prompted a stir in the 2016 presidential campaign over the weekend.\nTrump responded with\u00a0tough-sounding bromides\u00a0but little else, calling for \"strength\" and \"strong surveillance,\" more bombing in the Middle East and efforts to \"knock out\" the Islamic State's internet capabilities.\u00a0He also implied, not for the first time, that Obama is somehow\u00a0sympathetic or even connected\u00a0to Muslim terrorists -- a charge that a House investigative committee on terrorist sympathizers, like the one proposed by Gingrich, might be tasked with looking into.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\nHow to help:", "title": "Newt Gingrich Suggests Reforming House Un-American Committee In Wake Of Orlando Shooting"}
