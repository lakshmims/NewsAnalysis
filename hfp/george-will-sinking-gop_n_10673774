The Washington Post writer said a Democratic presidency would be better than the alternative offered by\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0-- who once called Will a \"major loser.\"\u201cMake sure he loses,\" Will said of the presumptive GOP nominee. \"Grit their teeth for four years and win the White House.\"\u00a0\nHis voter registration in Maryland has now changed from Republican to \"unaffiliated,\" PJ Media reported. The final straw was House Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis) endorsement of Trump, he said.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, Trump continues to fumble over himself. Just this week, he fired his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski before setting off to Scotland to promote his golf resorts.\u00a0\n\u201cHe had one good day because he didn\u2019t vomit all over himself and gave a decent speech,\u201d GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak said of Trump.\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\u00a0\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\u00a0\n", "title": "George Will Jumps From Sinking Ship That Is The GOP"}
