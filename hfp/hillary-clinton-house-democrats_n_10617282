Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), has yet to formally bow out of the race.\u00a0Yet Democrats leaving a nearly two-hour discussion with the former secretary of state in the U.S. Capitol did not seem to be worried about division within the party. Instead, it appeared that Clinton had sent a wave of excitement through the caucus, which hasn\u2019t held the majority since 2010.\nDemocrats\u2019 numbers in the House have continually fallen since the chamber flipped six years ago. This year more than ever, however, they're hopeful that will change -- thanks, in large part, to presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d Clinton told reporters as she emerged from the meeting beside House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). \u201cWe\u2019re going to take back the House and the Senate.\u201d\nClinton didn\u2019t stop to answer any questions from press, but at least a dozen members of Congress told The Huffington Post she thinks the House is within reach. (The chances of that are slim, as Republicans\u00a0hold their largest majority since 1928.)\n\u201cShe said that \u2018I know the difference between having the House and not having the House, and I want the House so I\u2019m going to do everything I can to help,\u2019\u201d Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) said.\nRep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) said Clinton reassured them that everyone would come together and that Democrats \u201cwere not going to be like Trump.\u201d\n\u201cShe said it\u2019s not just about her... it\u2019s about all of us,\u201d Meeks added. \nClinton talked up her\u00a0\u201c50-state strategy,\u201d\u00a0promising to campaign across the country.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous energy in terms of potential in a whole host of races,\u201d Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) said.\nClinton spoke briefly, spending the majority of her time taking questions on individual issues in specific districts. \nNotably absent from the conversation, according to members who spoke with reporters afterward, was any mention of Republicans\u2019 ongoing investigation into the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, and the FBI's probe into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while at the State Department. \nThe division between Sanders and Clinton, however, did come up.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), chair of the party\u2019s platform drafting committee, said Clinton didn\u2019t appear concerned about working with the Vermont senator to ensure that his supporters will ultimately rally behind her. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be meeting on Friday in St. Louis to try to air out some things -- try to meld the positions of Sen. Clinton and Bernie Sanders,\u201d Cummings said of the platform committee. \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s coming along very good so far, seems as if we will be able to reach an agreement by Saturday afternoon.\u201d\nSanders' decision to hold off on backing Clinton hasn\u2019t sat well with a number of Democrats in both chambers.\n\u201cThat is a problem for the party,\u201d said Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), a member of House Democratic leadership. \u201cI would love to see Mr. Sanders endorse, go all in, and I think he will.\u201d \nRep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y) said Clinton called on members to be \u201cclosely coordinated.\" She added that the race can\u2019t just be about reacting to Trump, and that 2016 \u201cis going to be a national security election\u201d -- an issue Democrats have struggled with in the past.\nPelosi shared a story from a recent White House reception involving a young boy who stared at a painting of former President Bill Clinton and asked who he was. Another child responded, \u201cThat\u2019s Hillary\u2019s husband.\u201d\nAt another point during the meeting, Democrats erupted in laughter as Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) teased Rep. Xavier Becerra of California for bringing Clinton water, according to a Democratic aide.\u00a0\n\u201cMan, you are working it hard,\u201d Crowley told Becerra, alluding to the House Democratic chair's rumored vice presidential ambitions.\u00a0\nOverall, Democrats appeared pleased with Clinton. Whenever asked about her weaknesses, they shifted topics to how differently Republicans are reacting to their likely nominee.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen Donald Trump comes, Republicans are going to have recruit interns to sit in the seats,\u201d Israel said. \u201cIn this case Democrats were fighting to be seen, and that\u2019s a -- for Democrats the leading indicator in optimism for a presidential candidate is when you sit close, up front to make eye contact and a lot of my colleagues were fighting for up-front seats.\u201d", "title": "Hillary Clinton Reassures House Democrats 2016 Is Not Just About Her"}
