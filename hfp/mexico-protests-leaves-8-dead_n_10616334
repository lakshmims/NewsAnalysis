Ruben Nunez, head of one of the most combative factions of Mexico's CNTE union, Oaxaca's Section 22, was detained on suspicion of money laundering.\nThe CNTE has led efforts to resist federal education reforms, particularly its mandate to carry out teacher evaluations. Miguel Zurita, a CNTE representative in Oaxaca, said that when police arrived to dislodge Sunday's protest near Nochixtlan, they were unwilling to enter into a dialogue.\u00a0\n\"What we lived through yesterday was something brutal, something that has no name,\" he said. \"They arrived armed and they arrived shooting.\"The Mexican government, however, defended its handling of the protests.\nIn a statement, the National Security Commission denied federal forces had used firearms against protesters, saying images circulating online of police with rifles were faked.\nEnrique Galindo, the head of Mexico's federal police, said masked individuals who were not affiliated to the teachers' union were behind much of the violence, lobbing Molotov cocktails and shooting at police and civilians.", "title": "Violent Clashes Between Mexico's Teachers, Police Leave 8 People Dead"}
