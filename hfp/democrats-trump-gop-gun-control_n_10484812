Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), chair of the House Democratic Caucus, also acknowledged the pain that the Latino community, \u201chit especially hard\u201d in the attack, was feeling.\nAnd then the grief turned to anger. Voices rose as the Democratic leaders excoriated their Republican colleagues for blocking attempts to bring Republican-authored legislation to the floor that would bar people on terrorist watch lists from purchasing firearms. \nWhile Democrats predict the bill would garner enough Republican support to pass if it reaches the floor, it\u2019s not without controversy. A number of Republicans in both chambers say it denies due process rights\u00a0to people on the watch lists. Gun rights advocates, as well as civil liberties groups, have also expressed concerns about the legislation.\nPointing to public polling and the need to take action, Democrats argued that the bill is a step in the right direction. Becerra said Democrats weren't urging a vote on an assault weapons ban because they are \u201ctired of not being able to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cWe certainly have a number of us who are supporters of the assault weapon ban, but let\u2019s try to get something done and let\u2019s see how far Republicans are willing to go,\u201d he added.According to a New England Journal of Medicine\u00a0study conducted in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, 86 percent of gun owners supported barring people on terrorist and no-fly lists from buying weapons. \n\u201cRefusing to enact \u2018no fly, no buy\u2019 is a form of political criminal negligence,\u201d Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.) said of House Republicans. \nHinting at potential consequences for the GOP come November, Israel didn\u2019t try to hide Democrats\u2019 agenda, saying they plan to latch onto this message to pressure Republicans and grab the public\u2019s attention.\n\u201cEvery time Speaker [Paul] Ryan (R-Wis.) tries to gavel us down, we\u2019re going to speak louder,\u201d he said. \u201cHe may be able to use a gavel as a tool against us, but we\u2019re going to use common sense and public sentiment against them, and you can absolutely count on that.\u201d \nAsked if they were encouraged by presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s intention to meet with the National Rifle Association about prohibiting gun sales to those on terrorist watchlists, Democrats seemed wary.\u201cIf con man Don can convince the NRA to move forward on this, God bless him,\u201d said Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.). \u201cBut again, this just goes to show the power of the NRA that their presidential nominee will go on hand and knee, begging for them to give them a pass on this issue so that it can trickle down to all the other members of the House.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s position on the issue \u201cis irrelevant,\u201d Israel said, pointing to the division among Republicans over their presumptive nominee. On Tuesday, Republicans scrambled to avoid questions about Trump, and even insisted that the GOP doesn't\u00a0have a nominee.\u00a0\n\u201cIf Donald Trump decides today that he supports \u2018no fly, no buy,\u2019 it will be just the latest disagreement that House Republicans say they have with him,\u201d said Israel.\nOn Wednesday, the NRA said its position on terrorist watch lists remained the same. The group said it agrees firearms should not be sold to terrorists, but does not back legislation that lacks due process protections.\nSenate Democrats took over the chamber floor on Wednesday\u00a0to discuss gun violence.", "title": "Democrats Troll Donald Trump And Republicans On Gun Control"}
