Journalists receiving credentials at times have also\u00a0faced restrictions on their ability to report inside events.\u00a0\nBuzzFeed's McKay Coppins wrote Wednesday that he,\u00a0along with journalists from outlets such as Slate, Gawker and Rolling Stone, was initially stopped by security at the Trump Soho hotel prior to the candidate's speech aimed squarely at presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\u00a0After security tried escorting out the reporters, Coppins described how\u00a0campaign press secretary Hope Hicks intervened and offered to find space for the journalists. The group entered the event soon after.\u00a0\nHicks declined to comment.\nThe decision to allow BuzzFeed inside, a move coming days after the firing of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, an operative renowned for his\u00a0hostile dealings with journalists, could be seen as a thaw in the relationship between the Trump campaign and the press.\u00a0\nBut the media blacklist doesn't appear to have been universally relaxed.\u00a0The Washington Post's Lois Romano and Jose DelReal were not allowed inside the same event, Romano tweeted Wednesday.The Washington Post's Paul Farhi wrote Monday that the campaign's restrictions on supposedly banned outlets \"are often arbitrarily enforced and vaguely defined.\" Though Trump\u00a0announced on Facebook that the Post would be banned from receiving press credentials over a specific headline, the campaign hasn't made similar public pronouncements when other outlets, like BuzzFeed, found themselves cut off.\u00a0\nCoppins wrote a critical profile of Trump in 2014 and predicted, like many politics watchers, that the reality TV star would never actually run for president. But the Trump campaign hasn't explicitly given a reason why BuzzFeed was put on the blacklist throughout the 2016 cycle\u00a0--\u00a0a question the site's Washington bureau chief, John Stanton, unsuccessfully tried getting answered\u00a0in a video posted Tuesday.\u00a0Editor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump's Campaign Finally Lets BuzzFeed Into An Event"}
