Very good. However, you need to know what to choose, especially at a restaurant. Outside Italy, how can you interpret the wine list and pick a high-quality product? Cinzia Benzi, a friend and sommelier, but also the organizer of one of the most important food conferences in Italy (and the world), \u201cIdentita\u0300 Golose\u201d conceived by Paolo Marchi, gave me some valuable advice.\nTHESE HAVE TO BE ON THE LIST Some wines that have now become brands and are mainly produced in speci c Italian regions should always been on a good wine list. It is important that they be associated with the right regions: Chianti, Morellino, Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino (Tuscany); Barolo and Barbera d\u2019Asti (Piedmont); Amarone della Valpollicella (Veneto); Nero d\u2019Avola (Sicily); Pinot Grigio (Trentino and Veneto). It is also important that, alongside the names of the wines, you see the acronym DOC or DOCG, which respectively stand for controlled designation of origin, and controlled and guaranteed designation of origin. These are not meaningless letters, as they will make you con dent that you are buying a quality product, because they guarantee that the product has passed checks and taste tests, that they pertain to a speci c territory, and that they are truly \u201cthose\u201d wines.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOTTLE\nIn addition to being written on the wine list, check that these acronyms are also on the bottle. If the region of origin is not speci ed on the list, ask your sommelier when you are served the bottle with the name of the wine you chose. If you\u2019re offered a Primitivo from Tuscany, send it back: Primitivo, a DOC red, can only come from the Manduria area, in Puglia.\nPROSECCO\nThis has become an international word, but if you\u2019re at a restaurant and want a good one, check to see if next to the name you nd DOCG \u201cConegliano Valdobbiadene \u2013 Prosecco\u201d and \u201cColli Asolani \u2013 Prosecco\u201d (or \u201cAsolo\u201d \u2013 \u201cProsecco\u201d), which indicate even more limited production areas and products of guaranteed quality.\nThe price counts. Beware of a wine being sold at less than half the price of the other ones on the list. Given customs fees and markup, a quality wine can\u2019t possibly be cheap. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to order the most expensive one, but once you check the average price for the same type (red, white, bubbly), choose one with a price aligned with similar wines.\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOD PAIRINGS\nThe best pairing is the one that hasn\u2019t been suggested yet, according to a French mai\u0302tre d\u2019, but the truth is that the pairing has to appeal to the person eating that dish and choosing that wine. When\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou think about a good plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce, Milanese-style risotto, spaghetti alla carbonara or a Sicilian arancino, you\u2019re spoiled for choice. I would enjoy the spaghetti with tomato with a good Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi DOC, the risotto with a Franciacorta DOCG Sate\u0301n, the carbonara with a Pinot Bianco dell\u2019Alto Adige and the arancino with a good Nero d\u2019Avola.\n\n\n", "title": "You Can Assess An Italian Restaurant Based On Its Wine"}
