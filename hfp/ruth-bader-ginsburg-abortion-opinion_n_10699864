Women without access to safe and legal abortion in the state have already started to buy abortion pills from Mexico and take matters into their own hands.\u00a0\nBut Monday's Supreme Court decision in\u00a0Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt does not only affect Texas. Many GOP-led state legislatures, especially across the South, have passed laws similar to the Texas law that are designed to regulate abortion clinics out of business. These so-called TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) laws fly in the face of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the two major abortion decisions of the last century that prevent states from imposing an \"undue burden\" on women's ability to get a safe and legal abortion.\nGinsburg made it clear in her concurring opinion on Monday that the high court will never allow these types of laws to stand.\u00a0\n\"So long as this Court adheres to Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,\" she wrote, \"Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers laws like H.B. 2 that 'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion,'\u00a0cannot survive judicial inspection.\"\u00a0", "title": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg Smacks Down Future Abortion Restrictions In A Single Paragraph"}
