They've both won against the odds.\u00a0And soon, they'll both be retired.\nFormer New York Yankees player Derek Jeter recently sat down with President Barack Obama and told him what it was like to hang up the spikes for the last time.\u00a0He smiled as he told the president what to expect on his first day off the job: \u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep a lot.\u201d\n\u201cI slept. I don\u2019t think I got up,\u201d Jeter said in a conversation with Obama that was published Wednesday on Jeter's website,\u00a0The Players\u2019 Tribune.\u00a0\nThe president said he had similar plans for his early days in retirement.\n\u201cDerek, that is my intention as well,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m going to catch on some sleep.\u201d\u00a0\nReady For 'That Post-Administration Glow'\nObama told The Huffington Post last year that he\u00a0looked forward to sleeping more when his presidency ended. When asked how much rest he gets a night, he said, \u201cProbably not enough.\u201d\n\u201cI will say that when people leave the administration and I see them six months later, they have that post-administration glow,\u201d Obama said at the time. \u201cThey look really good. So I\u2019m hoping the same happens to me.\u201d\u00a0Following Jeter's advice could help with that, Mr. President:\u00a0Research has shown that getting more sleep can actually make you look more approachable and less weary, and can\u00a0keep your skin looking younger.\nThere is currently no research on whether sleep can keep hair from graying.There's Rest Ahead For A President Who Doesn't Nap\u00a0\nThe president\u2019s sleep also came up during Thursday's White House press briefing.\n\u201cDo you have any way of quantifying how much sleep the president gets most nights, and should we be worried that he doesn\u2019t get enough?\u201d a reporter asked Press Secretary Josh Earnest,\u00a0referencing the Jeter interview.\nThere are valid reasons to be concerned about a commander in chief who doesn\u2019t get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation can lead to trouble focusing and remembering things,\u00a0increased stress levels and poor decision-making.\nHowever, Earnest assured the White House press corps that they didn't need to be concerned about the president\u2019s sleep debt.\n\u201cI think what the president would say is he gets enough, but he\u2019d be happy to get a little bit more,\u201d Earnest said.\nThe press secretary noted that he has never seen Obama take a nap.\n\u201cCertainly not during a workday,\" Earnest said.\u00a0\"No, I cannot think of a situation where I\u2019ve seen the president napping.\u201d\n\u201cI think he would enjoy the opportunity to have some more sleep -- and have more sleep that was more restful without the weight of the world on his shoulders,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s looking to a post-presidency that includes more and more restful sleep.\u201d\nSarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post\u2019s sleep reporter.
