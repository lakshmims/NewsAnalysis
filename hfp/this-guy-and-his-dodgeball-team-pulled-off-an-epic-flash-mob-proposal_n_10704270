The grand finale was -- what else? --\u00a0Bruno Mars' \"Marry You.\"It wasn't until DiMeo joined the flash mob that Bartic realized this performance was all for him. That's when the waterworks started.\u00a0\n\"I\u2019ve never seen him cry so hard. It was the most emotional I have ever seen him,\" DiMeo told HuffPost. \"I knew by his reaction that he was overwhelmed, in a good way, with this entire experience. I mean the room was full of dancing queens, all for him!\"Bartic was so overcome with emotion that he couldn't speak the word \"yes,\" but he shook his head up and down to let DiMeo know his answer.\nPlanning for the proposal began in October 2015 when DiMeo started a secret Facebook group to gather a group of players who wanted to be involved. They held dance rehearsals three nights a week from January through March to practice the choreography.The couple recently celebrated their 6-year anniversary in April. They first met when Bartic was working at a bar in Pittsburgh's Strip District.\n\"This bar was short-lived, but I am forever grateful for whoever the owner was who started it,\" DiMeo said. \"If it wasn\u2019t for that person, I would never have met him.\"\nWatch the joy-filled video above to see how the proposal played out.\u00a0", "title": "This Guy And His Dodgeball Team Pulled Off An Epic Flash Mob Proposal"}
