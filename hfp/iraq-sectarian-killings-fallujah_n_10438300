The United Nations has said up to 90,000 people are trapped in the city with little food or water.\nRepeated phone calls to three spokesmen of the Popular Mobilisation Forces were not answered. Last week, one of them, Kareem Nuri, said past accusations of human rights violations were \"politically motivated and baseless\".\n(Additional reporting by Stephen Kalin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy)", "title": "Iraq Is Investigating Alleged Executions Of Sunnis In Fallujah"}
