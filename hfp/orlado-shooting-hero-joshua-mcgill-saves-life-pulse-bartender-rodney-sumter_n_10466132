McGill, who is a nursing student, sprung into action, taking off his and Sumter\u2019s shirts and using them as tourniquets to stop the bleeding on both of Sumter\u2019s wounds.\nKnowing that Sumter would need medical attention, McGill began to lead him through the parking lot in search of help when he discovered that Sumter had a third wound on his back. McGill applied as much pressure as he could until the two stumbled upon police.\nThe officers offered to drive the men to the emergency room and instructed McGill to lie down in the patrol car with Sumter on top of him. McGill was then told to squeeze Sumter\u2019s back in order to constrict the blood.\n\u201cI can hear the police officers in the front seat saying, \u2018Keep him conscious, talk to him,\u2019\u201d McGill told \"GMA.\" \u201cThat\u2019s when I learned his name.\u201d\nSumter also told McGill his age, that he was from Jacksonville, Florida, and that he had a little brother.\u00a0\nMcGill asked Sumter to pray with him and then offered him words of support, telling CNN that he told Sumter that he promised him that he\u2019d be OK.\nAfter dropping Sumter off at the hospital, a traumatized McGill came home and posted about the incident on Facebook hoping to connect with someone who knew Sumter and could offer information on his condition.\u201cI felt God put me at the club and made me stay behind to help a complete stranger,\u201d he wrote on the post that got over 3,000 shares. \u201cFor whatever reason that may be. I don't know, but I do know it was hopefully to save his life.\"\nOn Monday, McGill learned that Sumter, a father of two, was having surgery and was in stable condition.According to a Facebook video McGill posted on Monday, he is still very shocked and overwhelmed by the experience.\u201cI\u2019m just really upset,\u201d he said on the brink of tears in the video. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy to be alive \u2026 I\u2019m happy people got out safely, I\u2019m happy for Rodney.\u201d\nHe adds:\u00a0\u201cI just did what I had to do at the time.\u201d", "title": "Orlando Clubgoer Uses Shirt As Tourniquet To Save Bartender After Shooting"}
