They\u2019re not judgmental and they\u2019re good listeners, which is good because talking is an important part of healing process. It allows people to process what happened.\u201dThe donation-based group, whose dogs were on the scene during the aftermath of the Sandy Hook shooting and the Boston marathon bombing, has spent its time in Orlando visiting police stations, counseling centers and were some of the thousands of attendees at Monday night\u2019s vigil outside Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts \u2014 a little more than a mile from the gay club where the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history took place.\u201cWe go where we\u2019re invited and we don\u2019t charge the people we serve,\u201d Hetzner said.\nThe program started in August 2008 with just four dogs, Hetzner said. The group now has more than 100 dogs in 23 states, according to ABC.Hetzner also adds that all their dogs go through a 12- to 14-month certification program with professional trainers, which starts when the pup is only 8 weeks old.\n\u201cOur dogs have to be able to relate with all age groups and stay calm in all circumstances,\u201d Hetzner said.In regards as to why the group sticks solely with golden retrievers, Hetzner explains:\n\u201cThey\u2019re good dogs by nature, they\u2019re a lovable breed. Also, because of their fur, they leave a little of themselves with everyone they meet.\u201d", "title": "Comfort Dogs Provide Emotional Support After Orlando Shooting"}
