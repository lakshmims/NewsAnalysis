We must set ourselves free from dictatorial Brussels,\" said the tabloid, which has a circulation of 1.7 million.\nOther polls published on Monday also put \"Leave\" ahead, while betting odds on Brexit narrowed.\nAn ORB poll for The Daily Telegraph put support for \"Leave\" at 49 percent, compared with Remain's 48 percent, while two ICM polls, one online and one conducted by telephone, found \"Out\" held 53 percent support compared with 47 percent support for \"In,\" the Guardian newspaper, which sponsored the telephone poll said.\nThat compared with a 52-48 percent split in favor of \"Out\" in ICM polls two weeks ago, the Guardian said. Those polls excluded respondents who answered \"don't know.\"\nA poll published on Friday which gave \"Out\" a 10 percentage-point lead added to pressure on sterling and pushed the cost of hedging against huge swings in the exchange rate to record highs [GBP/].\nICM said it interviewed 1,000 adults by telephone and 2,001 adults online between June 10 and 13.\nIncluding people who said they did not know how they would vote, the telephone poll showed 50 percent of people backed \"Out,\" 45 percent supported \"In,\" and 5 percent were classed as \"don't know\", ICM said.\n\nThe online poll showed \"Out\" leading \"In\" by 49 percent to 44 percent with 7 percent saying they did not know how to vote.\nBoth polls showed falls in the share of \"don't knows,\" ICM said.\n\"As we close on referendum day, evidently minds are being made up,\" ICM director Martin Boon said in a statement.\nOpinion pollsters are under pressure because they failed to forecast both Prime Minister David Cameron's unexpectedly decisive election victory and the result of Israel's election last year.\n(Writing by James Davey and William Schomberg; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n", "title": "Polls Show Increasing Support For Brexit; Murdoch's Sun Backs 'Leave'"}
