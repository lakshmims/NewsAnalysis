As a result, wars are fed, not people,\" said Francis, who has often condemned arms manufacturing and trafficking.\nIn January, U.N. Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon accused both the Syrian government and rebels of using starvation as a weapon, calling the practice a war crime.\nThe Argentine pope said the rich world was increasingly desensitized, \"growing immune to other people\u2019s tragedies, seeing them as something 'natural' ... all those human lives turn into one more news story.\"\nFrancis, who in the past has condemned speculation in food commodities as undermining the fight against poverty and hunger, also condemned rich countries' wasteful use of food.\n\"We have made the fruits of the earth \u2013 a gift to humanity \u2013 commodities for a few, thus engendering exclusion. The consumerism in which our societies are immersed has made us grow accustomed to excess and to the daily waste of food,\" he said.\n\"We need to be reminded that food discarded is, in a certain sense, stolen from the table of poor and the starving.\"\n\u00a0\n(Editing by Robin Pomeroy)\n", "title": "Pope Condemns Hunger 'Used As Weapon Of War'"}
