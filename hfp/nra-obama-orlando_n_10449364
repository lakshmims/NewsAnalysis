Cox blasted appeals\u00a0by President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to limit access to assault-style weapons.\n\"They are desperate to create the illusion that they\u2019re doing something to protect us because their policies can\u2019t and won\u2019t keep us safe,\" wrote Cox. \"This transparent head-fake should scare every American, because it will do nothing to prevent the next attack.\"\nCox called for the destruction of \"radical Islam,\" describing the movement as \"a hate crime waiting to happen.\" He also blamed the Obama administration, saying a policy of\u00a0\"political correctness\" allowed the Orlando killer to avoid punishment for making\u00a0threatening comments about minorities\u00a0at his job as a security guard.\u00a0A now-expired federal ban on sales of assault weapons, and state bans like California's (which have been skirted by gun industry manufacturing tweaks) have done little to curb gun violence, Cox pointed out. Efforts to halt the sale of these weapons, he said, would \"destroy the right of law-abiding Americans to defend ourselves.\"\nCox failed to note that, according to a study by the FBI, 94 percent of terrorist attacks in the U.S. from 1980 to 2005 were carried out by non-Muslims. America has more guns per capita than any Western nation, and by far\u00a0more firearms homicides per day.\nObama has long said he has no plans to take away anyone's access to guns,\u00a0and only wants limits on those capable of causing mass death.As HuffPost's Nick Wing and Mollie Reilly note, these weapons are meant for use on the battlefield. They're designed for efficient killing and have become the go-to gun for mass shootings.\nThe NRA piece was published alongside a damning editorial from the USA Today editorial board, which noted that assault-style weapons are \"easy to buy legally in most states.\" The newspaper called for such weapons to be banned and chastised gun lobbyists for \"[standing] in the way of such logical changes.\"\n\"The abundance of assault weapons, and the ease with which they can be purchased in the USA, is a gap that gives mass shooters an edge and has buoyed even the nation\u2019s worst enemies,\" the editorial said.\nA 2013 effort to reform gun laws in the wake of the Connecticut elementary school massacre\u00a0failed in Congress.\u00a0A December poll found just 45 percent\u00a0of Americans supported curbs.\u00a0\nMaybe Orlando will change that.", "title": "NRA Blames Obama For Orlando Shooting, Says Gun Control Would 'Do Nothing'"}
