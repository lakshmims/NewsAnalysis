Far from relegated to writing and directing movies only centered on their own personal or emotional experiences, women have been creating genre films for decades -- since the silent film era.\nAlice Guy-Blach\u00e9, a filmmaker credited with making one of the first narrative films, made her debut with a weird, fantastical story about a cabbage patch alive with young children, grown by a woman. She\u2019s honored alongside those of her ilk and those inspired by her in a Film Forum series \u201cGenre is a Woman,\u201d paying homage to women filmmakers working in the genres of action, Western, horror, fantasy and sci-fi -- many of which secure bigger budgets than their more realistic counterparts.\nGuy-Blach\u00e9 might\u2019ve been a forebear but plenty of contemporary women have followed her lead, including Mary Harron, director of the biting dark comedy \u201cAmerican Psycho,\u201d and Stephanie Rothman, whose \u201cThe Student Nurses\u201d features a gritty abortion scene.\nI spoke with writer and curator Giulia D\u2019Agnolo Vallan about the series, and about the problem with gendering movie preferences:\"The Notorious Bettie Paige,\" directed by Mary Harron\u201cGenre\u201d typically signifies action rather than, say, personal relationships. Why do you think it\u2019s important to embrace women who direct more action-fueled stories?\nI love genre, in all its forms -- Western, horror, noir, sci-fi. That's my passion. And as a filmgoer I always resisted the idea of \u201cwomen films\u201d -- or \u201cmen films,\u201d for that matter. I think it is important to embrace women that don\u2019t subscribe to those clich\u00e9s. The idea that a woman director has, by definition, less affinity for an action scene than a male one is silly. Kathryn Bigelow can out-direct most of her male colleagues in Hollywood. It's a matter of vision, talent, stylistic and poetic inclinations. Not gender.\u00a0\nBesides,\u00a0violence, sex, crime, the darkness in the human soul [are] the texture of genre cinema, [and] part of our collective experience. Not just the male one. I like the gaze, the depth, the humor and the subversive spirit that the directors like the ones in this series have brought to their representation.\nWomen directors have always taken on more traditionally \u201cmasculine\u201d themes in film. What is one of the earliest examples of this?\nWomen filmmakers frequently directed genre in the silent era. In the series, we have a little program devoted to one of the great directors of that period, Alice Guy-Blache, which includes an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum.\u201d Among her surviving films is a Western that I would have liked to show, but the print is in a European archive and we could not get it at this time.\u00a0\nWhat is your favorite genre film directed by a woman?\nI can\u2019t say. Favorites to me are the films that keep talking to you no matter how many times you watch them.\n\u00a0\"Point Break,\" directed by Kathryn Bigelow\u00a0\nOn the whole, would you say women\u2019s genre films -- including those in the series -- get the same funding as those directed by men?\u00a0\nOver the years, I interviewed more than a few directors that told me they were making documentaries because \"as a woman\" it was easier to get financing in that field, rather than getting it for a fiction film. So I am inclined to think there is less money, because it is assumed that films directed by women make less money. Although I believe that Roger Corman, who produced some of the titles of the series and has always been open to women directing genre, is an equal opportunity employer. His budgets are tight with everyone.\nWomen who direct genre films aren\u2019t directly addressing \u201cwomen\u2019s themes,\u201d but would you say they offer something that a male-directed genre film may not?\u00a0\nI would, although I hate to generalize, since we are talking about individual artists with their own specific visions. Sometimes it comes across as a certain humor, a critical perspective, a bigger investment in the characters. Stephanie Rothman's films come to mind, or Mary Harron's. But it is a slightly different view on the same world.\nCertain genres -- such as horror -- are notorious for objectifying women. Would you say the films in this series avoid this problem?\nI think the notion that horror objectifies women mostly derives from slasher [films]. I could argue against that notion, especially vis-\u00e0-vis filmmakers like John Carpenter. But in the series, we showed Amy Holden Jones' \u201cThe Slumber Party Massacre,\u201d which is almost a parody of slasher films. We also showed Katt Shea's \u201cStripped to Kill II: Live Girls,\u201d which plays it straight -- but not really. One can film anything; the key is how you film it. \u00a0\u00a0\nFilm Forum\u2019s \"Genre is a Woman\" series runs through June 16. Remaining films include \"Dance, Girl, Dance, \"American Psycho,\" \"Bury Me an Angel,\" \"Meek's Cutoff,\" \"Texas Killing Fields,\" \"Pet Sematary,\" \"Group Marriage,\" \"Let Me Die a Woman,\" \"Not Wanted,\" and \"Night Moves.\"", "title": "Action Movies Aren\u2019t Just For Dudes.
