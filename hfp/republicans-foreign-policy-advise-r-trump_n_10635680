Inevitably, the conversation turned to the 2016 elections and the reality television star at the top of the Republican ticket. \n\"If Donald Trump does get elected, I don\u2019t want to work in a Trump administration,\" one of Volker's friends said. \"But I want you two to go do it.\"\nSome Republican foreign policy hands -- including 121 who signed a letter listing the ways in which Trump\u2019s proposed foreign policy ideas would endanger the country -- describe a moral obligation to condemn the candidate often and loudly. \nBut some, like Volker and his friends, are thinking ahead. If Trump does end up winning the election in November, they reason, it would be good to have a few experienced foreign policy hands around who haven\u2019t offended the notoriously thin-skinned candidate. \n\u201cSigning that letter is like 140 of the smartest people that I can think of on foreign policy -- and now they\u2019re all going to be blacklisted,\u201d Volker said, referring to the March critique. \u201cIs that a good idea?\u201d \nVolker and several other conservative-leaning national security experts interviewed by The Huffington Post agree that there\u2019s plenty to criticize about the presumptive Republican nominee, who describes plans to cut off U.S. allies, cozy up to Russia, launch a trade war against China, reinstate torture as an interrogation method, target terrorists\u2019 families in airstrikes, build an expensive wall between the U.S. and Mexico, and ban all Muslims from entering the country. \nBut though they don't expect Trump to seek their guidance, many won\u2019t rule out working for him in the future. Working in a Trump National Security Council, Pentagon or State Department, they say, would be more about fulfilling a civic duty to their country in a time of desperate need than landing a career-enhancing opportunity. \u00a0Mitchell Reiss, who held several titles in the Bush-era State Department and went on to advise former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) in their presidential bids, described Trump as \u201cintellectually and temperamentally unqualified to become president.\"\n\u201cBut should he become president, I do think that nobody should reflexively eliminate the option of working in a Trump administration,\u201d Reiss continued. \u201cYou have to do what\u2019s best for the country \u2026 But I\u2019m not keeping my phone clear waiting for that call.\u201d\nAt least one of the signers of the anti-Trump letter won't rule out working for him at some point in the future. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out working for anyone once they\u2019re in the Oval Office,\u201d said former Romney adviser Matthew Kroenig, who now teaches at Georgetown University. \u201cI said in that letter I would work to stop Trump from being elected, and I stand by that \u2026 but I do think the country, the world, is probably better off if he has good people.\u201d\nThat calculation suggests a belief -- or at least, a hope -- that Trump is influenceable. Politicians who have come around and endorsed Trump sheepishly defended their support by suggesting that Trump is still figuring out this whole politics thing. He\u2019ll moderate his policies and rhetoric over time, they say. \nAn exhaustive survey by Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution of Trump\u2019s comments over the past several decades suggests the demagogic candidate will be hard to mold. Much of what appears to be impromptu spitballing is surprisingly consistent with his past statements. Trump has long warned that allies are taking advantage of the U.S.,\u00a0expressed antagonism towards Japan, and praised strongmen like Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. \nPeter Feaver, a Duke University professor who served in Bush\u2019s National Security Council, says that many in the conservative foreign policy community are skeptical of the benefits of publicly supporting the loudmouthed candidate. \u201cFirst, is the sense that he\u2019s likely to lose and you will be forever tarred if you endorse him,\" he said. \"Second, he is unlikely to listen to your advice. So even if he wins and you go in, the chance that you can do good is limited.\u201d\nThere\u2019s good reason to be concerned about a dearth of national security brainpower in Trump land. The campaign employs just 70 staffers and Trump once dodged a question about foreign policy advisers, telling MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski he likes to consult himself because he has a \u201cvery good brain.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cNone of my former colleagues from the Bush administration is advising Trump, I believe,\u201d Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in an email. Abrams, who was advising Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), said it\u2019s impossible, at this point, to answer the question of whether he\u2019d take a position in the Trump administration. \nScholars from the American Enterprise Institute offered advice to every campaign except that of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but nobody from the conservative think tank has signed on with Trump, said Danielle Pletka, the group\u2019s senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies. Volker said he has not met a single person from the community of foreign policy experts who has expressed an active desire to work in a Trump administration -- and many have flat out said they won\u2019t.\nBy March, reporters were regularly pressing Trump to reveal his team of foreign policy advisers. During a presidential debate, he name-dropped Richard Haass, the head of CFR, and Jack Keane, the retired general known for his role in pushing for the Iraq surge, as two people he respected. \nHaass, who has briefed several candidates, including Trump, declined to be interviewed.\nKeane said in an interview that he has advised five of the Republican presidential candidates -- but Trump was not one of them. The retired general recently received a phone call from Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the head of Trump\u2019s national security advisory committee, who told Keane he was on a \u201cshortlist\u201d of foreign policy advisers. \nNothing came of the call. Keane is open to advising Trump but was left with the impression that he \u201cfailed the screen test\u201d after expressing disagreement with Sessions\u2019 vision of the U.S. pulling back from global affairs. \u201cThe worst thing for American foreign policy would be, in fact, to disengage further,\u201d said Keane, who characterizes himself as politically independent and habitually declines to endorse candidates. \nWhen Trump finally unveiled his team of foreign policy advisers, it was a crew of five largely unknown individuals. One, Walid Phares, had ties to a Lebanese militia and another, Joseph Schmitz, to the infamous private security contractor Blackwater. George Papadopoulos listed his role as a U.S. representative to the Model United Nations on his LinkedIn page -- an accolade he has since removed. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether their foreign policy advisory group has expanded since. \nFeaver, who served in government under both Bush and former President Bill Clinton, has had conversations with friends who said they would \u201chold their nose and support [Trump]\u201d if he were to become the nominee, but aren\u2019t yet ready to make it public. \u201cI suspect people are waiting for a string of good news that would create rhetorical cover to do stuff with him,\u201d Feaver said. \u201cAnd he keeps missing it.\u201d \nBut others think the idea of trying to influence Trump is a fool's game. \u201cI am in the category of people willing to burn every bridge,\u201d Kori Schake, a Hoover Institution fellow who served in the Bush administration and advised Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) during his 2008 presidential bid. \u201cGood people can and should try to work for him. But I am deeply skeptical that these people who go to work for Trump will be able to have any influence over his policies.\"\n\u201cWhat I think is more likely than a reconciliation with Trump by conservative foreign policy and defense policy experts,\" she added, \"is a slow, agonizing reconciliation that Hillary Clinton is a safer pair of hands.\u201d\nShe\u2019s voting for Clinton.\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\n", "title": "Republicans: We Don\u2019t Want To Work For President Trump.
