No identification had been made yet.\nHall was taken captive by the militants with three others from an upscale resort on Samal island, hundreds of miles east of Jolo. Another Canadian who was held captive, former mining executive John Ridsdel, was executed by the group in April.\nA Norwegian man and a Filipina are still being held.\nTrudeau told reporters that \"Canada holds the terrorist group who took Mr. Hall hostage fully responsible for this cold-blooded and senseless murder.\"\nHe said Sunday's attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, and the killing of Hall \"serve as devastating reminders for all of us, the vicious acts of hatred and violence cannot be tolerated in any form.\"\nAbu Sayyaf, based in the south of the mainly Roman Catholic Philippines, is known for kidnapping, beheadings and extortion.\nSecurity is precarious in the southern Philippines despite a 2014 peace pact between the government and the largest Muslim rebel group that ended 45 years of conflict.\nIn Manila, President-elect Rodrigo Duterte's national security adviser said Duterte's new government, which takes charge on June 30, would \"take a stronger action against lawlessness in the south.\"\n\"We cannot allow this situation to continue, this should end once and for all,\" Duterte's adviser Hermogenes Esperon told Reuters.\nAbu Sayyaf had initially demanded one billion pesos ($21.7 million) each for the detainees, but it lowered the ransom to 300 million pesos each early this year.\nPreliminary intelligence reports in the Philippines indicated Hall had been beheaded 10 minutes after a 3 p.m. deadline lapsed in the mountains outside Jolo's Patikul town.\nPhilippine media had already quoted Abu Raami, a spokesman for Abu Sayyaf, confirming the execution.", "title": "Philippines Confirms Militants Killed Canadian Hostage Robert Hall"}
