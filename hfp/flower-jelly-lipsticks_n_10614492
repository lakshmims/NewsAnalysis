Lovers of opaque or matte purples or reds may want to look elsewhere.What's most unique about the floral lip product is that, despite its clear appearance, it goes on pink. The color of the pink also varies depending on your body temperature.These chameleonic sticks retail between $25 to $30 and have already sold out. With knockoffs available on eBay, these lipsticks are on track to incite Kylie-like excitement for restocks. The next batch is now\u00a0available for pre-order\u00a0and will be restocked later this week.\u00a0\nKiss your other boring lipsticks goodbye.", "title": "These Gorgeous Flower Jelly Lipsticks Are Blowing Up On Instagram"}
