A search team on board along with investigators will now draw a map of the wreckage's distribution spots, the committee said in a statement.\nIt was not immediately known which parts of the plane had been found, nor whether the two flight recorders were nearby. The recorders, one for voice and another for data, were contained in the tail of the Airbus A320.\nPreviously collected debris will also be handed over to the investigation committee after \"standard procedures\" are completed by prosecutors who are currently holding it for forensic evidence, the statement added.\nTo recover the black boxes some 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) below the sea surface, investigators will need to pinpoint the signals to within a few meters and establish whether the pingers are still connected to the recorders.", "title": "Main EgyptAir Wreckage Locations Found By Search Team, Egypt Says"}
