McConnell holds an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association and opposes gun control measures like requiring tougher background checks at gun shows, mandating trigger locks and banning high-capacity magazines of over 10 bullets.\nAfter mass shootings,\u00a0\"thoughts and prayers\"\u00a0reliably stream in from those whose campaign coffers have been filled by the NRA. But lawmakers have been facing increasing criticism for offering mere platitudes rather than meaningful policy changes.\u00a0\nSee more responses to McConnell's call for a moment of silence:The Onion summed it all up in a faux commentary from McConnell titled \"At Times Like This, We Need To Pull Ourselves Up, Hold Our Loved Ones Close, Block Any Legislation That Would Prevent Suspected Terrorists From Buying Guns, And Say A Prayer For The Victims.\"", "title": "Mitch McConnell Calls For Orlando Moment Of Silence And Gets Loud, Angry Response"}
