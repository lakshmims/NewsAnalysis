Some people say the result must be accepted and dealt with accordingly, including politicians such as the Labour Party member of parliament Mike Gapes.The petition, which it has since emerged was actually launched by a \"Leave\" campaigner in the weeks before the vote, will also come as unwelcome news for Nigel Farage, the anti-EU leader of the UK Independence Party. But he doesn't have much cause to complain, given he said in May that a 52-48 win for the Remain side would be such a narrow margin that he'd fight for a second referendum to be held.\nThe surprise outcome of the EU vote result has sent global stock markets tumbling\u00a0and the\u00a0pound sterling plummeting to a 30-year low.\u00a0It's also prompted the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, and fears that other European nations could follow suit in leaving the union.\nUpdate:\u00a0The petition is now being investigated over allegations that some of the names that have been added could actually be fraudulent. According to the BBC, some 77,000 signatures were removed over the weekend.\n\"People adding fraudulent signatures to this petition should know that they undermine the cause they pretend to support,\" said lawmaker Helen Jones, who chairs the House of Commons petitions committee looking into the claims.", "title": "More Than 3.5 Million Britons Are Demanding A Second EU Referendum"}
