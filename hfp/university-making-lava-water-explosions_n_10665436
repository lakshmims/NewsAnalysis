Each batch involves putting 10 gallons of basaltic rock into a high-powered furnace, heating it to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, and pouring it out, the school said in a statement.\nOnce the process is perfected, likely later this summer,\u00a0researchers will begin exposing the molten rock to water. A university spokeswoman told The Huffington Post in an email that the experiments will \"provide a rare, close-up view of the interplay between lava and water, yielding insight on what conditions cause explosions.\"\nAlison Graettinger, a postdoctoral geology researcher at the university, said previous studies at Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg in Germany used smaller amounts of man-made lava, about the size of a coffee cup.\n\"No one has done it before on this scale, and these lava-water interactions aren\u2019t well understood,\" Graettinger said in a statement. \"Sometimes when water and lava meet, the lava will appear to completely ignore the water. Sometimes, the lava will cool and form distinctive cracking patterns, or form interesting shapes like pillow lavas. And sometimes, the reaction is violent. Why?\"\nThe research, funded by the National Science Foundation, is being conducted at a field station in Ashford, New York.\nLarge explosive events don't happen often, but prove lava-water interactions can pose serious threats, according to project leader\u00a0Ingo Sonder, a research scientist at the university\u2019s Center for GeoHazards Studies. In 2010, for instance,\u00a0an eruption at Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano\u00a0turned explosive after magma melted a large amount of ice.\n\"As geologists,\" Sonder said in a statement, \"we want to understand the conditions that generate explosions \u2014 how much water do you need? How much time?\"\nBasically,\u00a0these lava experiments are a lot more complicated than baking soda and vinegar.", "title": "Researchers Create Homemade Lava -- For Science, Of Course"}
