The family dynamics are complicated, to say the least, made up of many layers and built-in backstories. That's why, according to executive producer Oprah Winfrey, the first day of filming \"Greenleaf\" kicked off with a rather \"ironic\" scene.\nSitting down with \"Greenleaf\" lead Merle Dandridge (Grace \"Gigi\" Greenleaf), Oprah asks a pointed question about being on set when filming began.\u00a0\n\"This is what's ironic. First scene, first day is the family sitting at the table -- this is when you all have barely gotten to know each other,\" Oprah points out. \"What did it feel like sitting at that table?\"\nIn the sequence of the show, that family dinner scene occurs when Dandridge's character has returned to the family mansion after a 20-year absence. The scene is dripping with the tension and undertones that have built up over two decades, and yet, the cast themselves had barely had a chance to bond. Still, Dandridge believes they were all thinking the same thing in that moment.\n\"For everyone, it kind of solidified what I think we already knew: We were in something special,\" she says. \"We were all -- every single one of us -- going to be a part of making this an extraordinary journey.\"\nThe \"Greenleaf\" cast includes veteran actors like Emmy winners Lynn Whitfield and Keith David, and relative newcomers like Desiree Ross (\"A Country Christmas Story\") and Tye White (\"The People v. OJ Simpson\").\u00a0\n\"I knew that I was going to learn from these people, that I was going to grow from them and that I was going to come out on the other side even better than I could have even dreamed,\" Dandridge says.\n\"Greenleaf\" premieres with a two-night event beginning Tuesday, June 21, at 10 p.m. ET on OWN.\nAnother behind-the-scenes look at the show:\nOprah explains how her \"Greenleaf\" character is like Maya Angelou, \"if Maya Angelou ran a nightclub\"", "title": "Why The First Scene Filmed For Oprah's Upcoming Church Drama Was So 'Ironic'"}
