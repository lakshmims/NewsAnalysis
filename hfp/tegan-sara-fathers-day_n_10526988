Is it their hair? Is it that they're now viewed as lesbian pioneers and -- according to GQ -- menswear icons?\nProbably all of the above.Tegan and Sara Quin, who grew up in Alberta, Canada, in a divorced family, have channeled their upbringing, familial tension and romantic histories into eight albums. So for Father's Day, we wanted to know how their two dads (biological dad, Stephen Quin, and stepdad, Bruce MacDougall) influenced their style, and what they've learned from each.Here's what Sara said:\n\n\"Our dad Stephen hates clothes and especially hates shopping for them! My big takeaway was that my dad, for all his grumblings about clothing, had an effortless, messy charm that let him get by with some pretty bizarre looks over the years. The 1980s were all about jeans with band T-shirts tucked in and a battered jean jacket over top. The curly mop of hair and beard were pretty dang adorable and unkempt. These days he rocks a slouchy, casual look and continues to dress in a very unique way!\"\nSara went on to talk about the other influence in their lives:\n\"Our stepdad, Bruce, spent most of our childhood in the 1980s and early '90s in Bruce Springsteen tour T-shirts and leather jackets. Black Raybans ALWAYS. He and my mom loved to get dressed up on the weekend and take photos of themselves slouched up against his Camaro.\"\n", "title": "The 2 Dads Who Influenced Tegan And Sara's Legendary Style"}
