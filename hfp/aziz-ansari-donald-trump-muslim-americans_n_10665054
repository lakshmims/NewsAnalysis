Trump and others like him spewing hate speech, prejudice is reaching new levels,\" Ansari writes. \"It\u2019s visceral, and scary, and it affects how people live, work and pray. It makes me afraid for my family. It also makes no sense.\"\nHe backs up that assertion with a series of anecdotes -- and, yes, a few humorous quips -- including what the 9/11 attacks looked like through his eyes and how he was treated as a then-unknown student at New York University, mere blocks from where the attack took place.\n\"There are approximately 3.3 million Muslim Americans. After the attack in Orlando, The Times reported that\u00a0the F.B.I. is investigating 1,000 potential 'homegrown violent extremists,' a majority of whom are most likely connected in some way to the Islamic State,\" Ansari writes, referencing this month's shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida.\n\"If everyone on that list is Muslim American, that is 0.03 percent of the Muslim American population. If you round that number, it is 0 percent. The overwhelming number of Muslim Americans have as much in common with that monster in Orlando as any white person has with any of the white terrorists who shoot up movie theaters or schools or abortion clinics.\"\nRead Ansari's full column here.\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Aziz Ansari Takes On Trump's Xenophobia In Moving New York Times Op-Ed"}
