Although Rumi was born in modern-day Afghanistan, the screenwriter and producer behind the film told The Guardian that they had their eyes set on Leonardo DiCaprio to play the lead role.\u00a0\n\"A blond, blue-eyed white man,\" Al-Khatahtbeh said. \"But when you think about it,\u00a0when we have roles in Hollywood, in television, in the media, that have to do with terrorists, that have to do with villains, that have to do with people that want to destroy us, that hate our freedoms, we have absolutely no problem finding brown actors to play those roles.\"\n\"It's so important for us to remember representation in these conversations.\"\nA short clip of Al-Khatahtbeh's remarks has gone viral on Facebook, earning more than 1.2 million views in about four days.\u00a0\nWatch the video above to hear Al-Khatahtbeh's comments.\u00a0", "title": "Muslim Girl Says What We're All Thinking About Diversity In Hollywood"}
