This atrocity would not go unanswered under President Trump I promise!!!!\u00a0#prayingfororlando #lgbt #pray #praying.\"\u00a0Trump made similarly disgusting comments in the wake of the nightclub tragedy, suggesting that Obama was in some way sympathetic to Islamic terrorism.\u00a0\n\u201c[Obama] doesn\u2019t get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands,\" Trump said on \"Fox and Friends\" Monday.\u00a0\"It\u2019s one or the other. And either one is unacceptable.\"\u00a0\nOn Sunday, Trump also argued that Obama should resign from office after the President spoke about the tragic shooting in Orlando.\u00a0\u00a0\n\"In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words \u2018Radical Islam,\u2019\" he said. \"For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words \u2018Radical Islam\u2019 she should get out of this race for the presidency.\"\u00a0\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Stacey Dash Says Orlando Shooting 'Would Not Go Unanswered' If Trump Were President"}
