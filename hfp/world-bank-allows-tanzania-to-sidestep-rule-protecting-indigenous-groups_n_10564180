Some of the fertile agricultural lands that SAGCOT is transferring to investors are being cleared by evictions of cattle herders in the Barabaig, Maasai and other indigenous communities. \u00a0\n\u201cIn Tanzania, it is as if we don\u2019t exist,\u201d said Salumu Kundaya Kidomwita, 60, a Barabaig cattle herder living within SAGCOT\u2019s Kilombero crop cluster. \u201cIt is as if this is not our country.\u201d\nKidomwita, whose surname translates to \u201cWarthog\u201d in the Barabaig language, is facing his second eviction in the last decade. After being pushed out of his home by a rice plantation in 2008, his new village of Kwa Wagonzi is being uprooted to make way for a dam that will provide irrigation for SAGCOT-backed rice and sugar farms.Tanzania\u2019s government contends that no ethnic groups in Tanzania are more indigenous than others because all Tanzanians are equal under the law. It successfully petitioned the bank to waive its policy requiring borrowers to consult and win \u201cbroad support\u201d from indigenous groups in order to approve a project that affects them.\nThe bank approved an exemption to the Indigenous Peoples Policy for SAGCOT on March 10. The bank\u2019s board also appears to poised to approve a second exemption to the indigenous peoples standard for another project in Tanzania, an initiative to aid poor families with cash transfers and other assistance.\nThe World Bank said that any waivers from safeguard policies were granted at the discretion of its governing board on a case by case basis.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no practice that has been adopted on this front,\u201d said a bank spokeswoman.\nThe bank also referred the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other media partners to a fact sheet on the project that the bank published four days after the reporting team submitted its questions.\nIn the fact sheet, the bank says the Tanzanian government had assured it that \u201cany land allocation to agribusinesses\u201d will be \u201cbased on community consent.\u201d Vulnerable groups affected by the project are entitled to \u201cfree, prior and informed consultation,\u201d mitigation of adverse impacts and access to a grievance mechanism, the bank said. \u00a0\nThe bank has come under fire in recent years for failing to follow its own rules for protecting vulnerable populations affected by the development projects that it finances.\nLast year, ICIJ, The Huffington Post, The GroundTruth Project and other media outlets reported on a World Bank-backed conservation program in Kenya that the indigenous Sengwer tribe said was used to evict them from their ancestral forests. Navin Rai, the World Bank\u2019s top indigenous affairs expert for more than a decade, left the bank in 2012 frustrated with what he described as the \u201ccosmetic way\u201d that management addressed the needs of vulnerable groups.\nThe World Bank has promised to fix shortcomings in its enforcement of its safeguard policies. In March 2015, the bank announced a plan to increase funding, resources and independence for the specialists who oversee these protections.\u2018We are called invaders\u2019\nKidomwita flashes a toothy grin as he arrives at his wife Annie Malinja\u2019s home, a rectangular structure of sticks, dung and mud that sits in a small clearing. He wears a black and gold New York Yankees cap and carries a long spear at his side, a vestige of his tribe\u2019s reputation as warriors. \nA Barabaig elder with four wives and 22 children, Kidomwita is accustomed to traveling with his herds. But he is now uncertain about his future and running out of places to go.\nNevdu Gileksa, 45, a fellow herder who is Kidomwita\u2019s neighbor in Kwa Wagonzi, says local government is driving out the Barabaig to make way for farmers and agribusiness\u2014a process spurred by SAGCOT\u2019s push for industrial-scale farming\n\u201cWe have been told to leave by local government without reason, but we know why,\u201d Gileksa said. \u201cThey are called investors. We are called invaders.\u201d\nEvictions have become all too familiar to Kidomwita. He was evicted two decades ago from the Hanang district to make way for a Canadian wheat farm, and again from his village of Lukolongo in the fertile Kilombero Valley in 2008. His land in Lukolongo was turned over to Kilombero Plantations Ltd., an agribusiness with its own nationally distributed wholesale rice brand that is now one of SAGCOT\u2019s leading partners.\n\"We suffer,\" says Kidomwita. \"Water is becoming scarce. As I age, the moving gets harder. We want to have our life here now.\"\nThe Tanzanian government launched SAGCOT in 2010 to promote economic growth in Tanzania\u2019s southern corridor, which covers a third of mainland Tanzania extending from the capital, Dar es Salaam, to Tanzania\u2019s border with Zambia. Over a 20-year period, SAGCOT aims to convert 350,000 hectares of land into commercial production, boost annual farming revenues by $1.2 billion and lift roughly 450,000 farming households out of poverty, \u00a0the Tanzanian government estimated.The effort seeks to achieve these gains by linking small farmers to agriculture companies, often multinationals, which it subsidizes to invest in the region.\nLivestock herders say the SAGCOT system has prompted authorities, mostly local and regional district councils, to evict them from their villages and grazing lands so they can offer them to farmers working with wealthy investors. The problem is exacerbated, they say, by the Tanzanian government\u2019s longstanding disapproval of indigenous herders and their way of life.\n\u201cOur people must change from being nomadic cattle herders to being settled modern livestock keepers,\u201d said Jakaya Kikwete, Tanzania\u2019s former president, in a 2005 address.\nThe World Bank prepared its initial planning documents to finance SAGCOT in 2011\u2014shortly before a series of cattle herder removal operations by the Tanzanian government.\nIn 2012 and 2013, a Tanzanian government effort dubbed Operation Save Kilombero Valley displaced some 5,000 herders from their homes or grazing lands, according to a report by the human rights group International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs. In 2013, an operation to remove all herders from Morogoro District evicted several more villages.\nPolice and other security forces carrying out the evictions committed human rights abuses against indigenous villagers, herders and their advocates claim.\n\u201cThese operations have included beatings, use of force, killing of animals. Women are raped,\u201d said Edward Porokwa, executive director of the PINGOs Forum, a coalition of indigenous groups in Tanzania.\nTanzania submitted its first social and environmental assessments of SAGCOT to the World Bank in 2012 and 2013. Its plan for resettling communities displaced by SAGCOT investments, prepared by a consultant in November 2013, even noted that prior evictions of herders had sparked allegations of human rights violations. \u00a0\u00a0The World Bank initially required Tanzania to follow the bank\u2019s rules for protecting indigenous communities like Kwa Wagonzi and Lukolongo. Tanzania\u2019s social and environmental assessment of the SAGCOT project, from December 2013, recognized Barabaig tribesmen like Kidomwita and members of another group called the Hadzabe as indigenous peoples who were entitled to protection under the bank\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Policy.\nThe policy mandates that borrowers recognize traditional land rights of indigenous groups and that indigenous communities must be consulted and provide \u201cbroad support\u201d in order for a project that affects them to proceed. The policy provides a higher level of protection to indigenous peoples than to others displaced by projects backed by the World Bank, a recognition that indigenous groups are often marginalized within their countries and that they generally share land communally and don\u2019t hold formal legal titles.\nAs Tanzania was pledging to abide by the bank\u2019s policies, Kidomwita\u2019s third eviction was being set in motion.\nIn 2013, Kidomwita was called to local district offices in Morogoro for a village meeting. The meeting marked the beginning of a massive resettlement process to make way for the Kidunda Dam, a project spearheaded by the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority.\nWhen officials from the district and a government development agency came to evaluate his land, Kidomwita told them that he didn\u2019t want to leave. The officials were unsympathetic, he said.\n\u201cThey told us that even if we refuse, we don\u2019t have land here,\u201d he says, bristling. \u201cSo it was if you accept you move, if you don\u2019t accept you move. How evil is that?\u201d\nThe evictions were imposed by a different government initiative from SAGCOT. But SAGCOT is among the main beneficiaries of the dam and the removals. Its investments include sugar and rice projects totaling 100,000 hectares in Morogoro District, where Kwa Wagonzi village is located. \u00a0\u00a0Big plantations could once more end up taking over Kidomwita\u2019s land.\nOther Barabaig villagers in Kwa Wagonzi also say they were not consulted in a fair and transparent manner, and that their community does not support projects that drive them from their land without their participation or offers of resettlement. \u00a0\u201cIt is the farmers who are invited to meetings about our land, not us,\u201d said Udangashega Wembida, 40, a mother of two from Kwa Wagonzi. Now \u201cwe are threatened with the bulldozers and roads being made for business. We are told by village leaders to go where we came - but that is here!\u201d\nAt a public forum last month, Nassor Duduma, an official with Tanzania\u2019s land ministry, said pastoralist herders shouldn\u2019t be allowed to claim independent indigenous status, because \u201call\u201d Tanzanians are indigenous. \u201cWe cannot isolate pastoralists,\u201d Duduma said.\u201cWe need to find a permanent place for them and reduce their cattle.\u201d\nThe Ministries of Natural Resources and Tourism, and Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries declined to comment.\n\u2018High risk operation\u2019\nThe World Bank\u2019s governing board voted in March to approve a $70 million loan to Tanzania to support the SAGCOT project and to waive its indigenous peoples policy. The bank\u2019s project appraisal document cited Tanzania\u2019s stance that the policy is \u201cinconsistent with Tanzania\u2019s Constitution,\u201d which emphasizes equal treatment of all ethnic groups. \u00a0\nThe appraisal noted an alternative approach to assist \u201cVulnerable Groups\u201d affected by the project, which includes social assessments of likely impacts on these populations, obtaining their \u201cbroad support\u201d for development plans and mitigating adverse consequences. The vulnerable groups listed in the document include the elderly, disabled and women-headed households, but not indigenous peoples.\nThe bank\u2019s board described SAGCOT as a \u201chigh risk operation\u201d and called for close supervision to ensure that \u201cthe level of protection for project-affected persons is equivalent\u201d to the Indigenous Peoples policy, according to the bank\u2019s summary of the board meeting.\nMatt McGuire, the United States\u2019 representative on the World Bank board, abstained from voting on the project and the waiver. \nIn a public statement explaining McGuire\u2019s abstention, the U.S. chided the bank for accepting Tanzania\u2019s argument that the Indigenous Peoples Policy violated the Tanzanian constitution, noting that Tanzania had applied the policy to previous and ongoing projects. The bank\u2019s failure to conduct public consultation on the project before the board\u2019s vote \u201cundermines a key principle of sustainable project design and planning,\u201d the U.S position statement added. \nThe World Bank has repeatedly faced criticism for its willingness to allow exceptions from its protections for indigenous communities and other marginalized populations. \nIn 2014, the inclusion of an \u201copt-out clause\u201d in its proposed revision of its Indigenous Peoples Policy sparked an outcry among indigenous peoples and their advocates.\n\u201cThe introduction of the opt-out clause directly and seriously undermines the very fundamental rights that indigenous peoples have over their lives, lands, territories and resources,\u201d a coalition of indigenous groups in Tanzania said in a joint letter to the World Bank in December 2014.\nThe World Bank retreated. When it released its second and most recent draft of its safeguards policy in July 2015, the opt-out clause was gone.\nAs the bank prepares its third and final version of its Indigenous Peoples Policy and other social safeguards policies, the bank\u2019s decision to grant Tanzania a waiver to the indigenous peoples rule has sparked fears among advocates that the bank is setting a broad precedent that could undermine the real-world effectiveness of its protections for populations in the path of development projects. \nThe Tanzanian government has also requested a waiver from the bank\u2019s indigenous peoples standard on another proposed World Bank project called Additional Financing for the Tanzania Productive Social Safety Net. The bank board is expected to vote on this project and the proposed waiver soon.\nNadia Daar of Oxfam International points to a policy change by the bank in 2014 that quietly updated the waiver policy that governs when it grants borrowers exceptions from applying its rules. \n\u201cThere needs to be much greater clarity on when the waiver policy can be applied,\u201d Daar said. \u201cWhat is the difference between the opt-out clause that had been put into the first draft of the safeguards, and the waiver policy which applies to the bank\u2019s entire set of safeguard policies?\u201d\nEdward Porokwa, the advocate who monitors human rights abuses against indigenous groups in Tanzania, has more immediate fears about the World Bank\u2019s decision to grant Tanzania a waiver.\n\u201cIt feels like they are giving a go-ahead for Tanzania to continue violating the rights of the people,\u201d Porokwa said.Sasha Chavkin is a reporter at ICIJ based in Washington, D.C.
