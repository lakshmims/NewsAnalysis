Terrified screams fill the car as the passenger struggles to get the door closed. The break-in joins a growing list of bizarre incidents in and around Yellowstone this year.\nLast month,\u00a0Yellowstone officials had to euthanize a newborn bison after well-meaning tourists put the animal into the trunk of their SUV. Just days later,\u00a0three Canadians faced criminal charges for stomping on the ecologically sensitive grounds of Yellowstone\u2019s legendary\u00a0Grand Prismatic Spring.\nEarlier this month,\u00a0video surfaced of an elk charging a woman who got too close to the animal in hopes of taking a photograph.\u00a0And last week, a 23-year-old Oregon man died after falling into one of the park's boiling hot springs.\u00a0\nCORRECTION: This article initially stated that the incident caught on camera occurred at Yellowstone National Park, and has been updated throughout.", "title": "Black Bear Casually Opens Car Door, Sends Family Into Fit Of Terror"}
