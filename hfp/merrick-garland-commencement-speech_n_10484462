Wilson Elementary School in Washington, D.C.\nGarland has tutored and mentored students at the school for 18 years.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just tutor somebody for a year,\" Principal Heidi Haggerty told WUSA9 in March. \"When he takes on a student, he follows them for many years.\u201d\nGarland got emotional while speaking about his own daughters' fifth grade graduation.\n\"Later today, when your family wants to take one more picture or give you an extra long hug, please let them. Don't roll your eyes,\" Garland said.\nGarland also advised the students to look out for their friends as they navigated through middle school, \"even if that means letting them know that they're wrong.\" Garland used the wise words of Professor Albus Dumbledore from the \"Harry Potter\" series to help make his point.\n\"As Professor Dumbledore told the Hogwarts class at the end of their school year, 'it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but as much to stand up to your friends.'\"\nIn May, Garland gave the commencement address at his high school alma mater, Niles West High School, near Chicago, where he encouraged\u00a0students to devote time to public service.\nWatch a video of Garland's speech above.\n\u00a0", "title": "Merrick Garland Tears Up During Fifth Grade Commencement Address"}
