British companies may end up creating more trash and dirtying the air in the wake of the Brexit, according to a new report.\u00a0\nWhen the EU's ambitious targets for reducing waste and increasing recycling first went into effect two years ago,\u00a0the United Kingdom\u00a0pushed back,\u00a0insisting that it would be too expensive for businesses to comply.\u00a0Once negotiations to leave the EU are complete -- a process that could take two years or more -- U.K. legislators may scale back those regulations, found a report examining environmental and social governance at U.K. corporations from investor research firm Sustainalytics.\n\u201cRecycling rights in the U.K. trailed off in the last few years,\u201d Doug Morrow, a Toronto-based associate director at Sustainalytics who co-authored the report, told The Huffington Post. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we found a relaxation of the recycling targets.\u201d\u00a0\nCompanies polluting the air in England may be able to breathe easier, too. In memos leaked to The Guardian in May, Rory Stewart -- the Conservative environment minister under Prime Minister David Cameron, who announced his resignation in the wake of the Brexit vote --\u00a0urged British members of the European parliament to undermine new EU regulations on air pollution by pushing for an amendment allowing Britain to exceed those standards.\u00a0\u00a0Such a change would give leeway to sectors that emit a lot of carbon into the atmosphere, such as the auto industry.\n\u201cWe would not be surprised if, once the terms [of the Brexit] are renegotiated, the U.K. moved to relax some of the domestic air pollution standards,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s relatively well known that the U.K. has struggled with implementing some of the EU\u2019s directives on this front.\u201d\nIn January, just eight days into the new year, London had already breached the EU\u2019s air pollution limits. \nEven so, there\u2019s no need to panic, Morrow said. The report, which judged British companies in nine areas of corporate governance, found that policy change was unlikely in all but recycling and air pollution. The other areas are climate change, human capital, product quality standards, health and safety, corporate governance, executive pay and intellectual property rights.\u201cWe don\u2019t foresee a likely divergence, certainly over the short run, because a lot of the relevant EU directives have become embedded in the way things are so foundationally,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cOn both sides of the debate, the Leave and the Stay, there was an exaggeration of what it\u2019ll mean for U.K. companies.\u201d\n\u201cThough,\u201d he added, \u201cobviously they have two years to negotiate the terms of the withdrawal.\u201d \nWhen you consider that in 2014 Cameron lauded the decision by Scottish voters to remain a part of the U.K., a lot can change in two years.", "title": "Brexit Could Encourage British Companies To Pollute And Waste More"}
