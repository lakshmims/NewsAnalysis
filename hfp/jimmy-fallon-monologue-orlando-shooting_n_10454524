What do I tell them?\"\u00a0\nThose were just some of the questions Jimmy Fallon, a father of two young girls, had following the Sunday morning attack at Orlando's LGBTQ nightclub Pulse that left 49 dead, at least 53 injured, and is the deadliest mass shooting\u00a0in U.S. history.\nOn Monday night, Fallon dedicated his monologue to the tragedy.\u00a0\n\"I, as a new father, am thinking, 'What do I tell my kids? What do I tell them about this? What can we learn from this? What if my kids are gay? What do I tell them?'\" he said. \"Maybe there's a lesson from all this. A lesson in tolerance. We need to support each other's differences and worry less about our own opinions. Get back to debate and away from believing or supporting the idea that if someone doesn't live the way you want them to live you just buy a gun and kill them, bomb them up. That is not OK.\"\nBut the talk show host wanted to make a point that goodness will always prevail.\u00a0\n\"This was just one bad guy here;\u00a049 good people\u00a0and one bad guy,\" he said, referencing the victims, \"and there will always be more good than evil.\"\u00a0", "title": "As A Father, Jimmy Fallon Has Some Poignant Questions After Orlando Shooting"}
