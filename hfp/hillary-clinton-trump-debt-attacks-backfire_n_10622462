Had their arguments for more stimulus prevailed sooner, the recovery might have been far less sluggish, they argue.\nThe controversy centers on comments Clinton made Tuesday during a speech attacking the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\u00a0The former secretary of state mocked Trump for calling himself the \"king of debt,\" noting that Trump's tax cuts would indeed cause the debt to skyrocket.\nClinton argued Trump\u2019s proposal to pay down the national debt by printing money would trigger hyperinflation and crash the economy.\n\u201cTrump also says, we can just print more money to pay our debt down. Well, we know what happens to countries that tried that in the past, like Germany in the '20s, or Zimbabwe in the '90s,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt drove inflation through the roof and crippled their economies. The American dollar is the safest currency on the planet. Why would he want to mess with that?\u201d\nOn its face, Clinton\u2019s critique is a typical Democratic line of attack on tax cuts for the rich and irresponsible fiscal policy. And suffice it to say, Trump\u2019s reversals on some of his most outlandish economic policy suggestions do not change the fact that his views are wildly incoherent.But Clinton\u2019s broadside against \u201cprinting money\u201d leaves room to be interpreted as maligning a fundamental tenet of progressive economics. Regardless of her views, Clinton's framing glosses over the distinction between positive budget deficits and harmful ones.\u00a0It doesn't help\u00a0that invoking the specters of Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe is a classic right-wing scare tactic, as David Dayen noted in The Intercept.\n\u201cI worry that we may see a resurgence of Democrats singing the virtues of balanced budgets as Clinton tries to distinguish herself from Trump's irresponsible tax cuts,\u201d said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal think tank. \u201cIn the context of an economy that can certainly use a boost now, and is virtually certain to face a recession somewhere in a two-term Clinton presidency, this is very bad news.\u201d\nWhen the job market has plenty of room to grow before excessive inflation becomes a problem, higher federal budget deficits and low Federal Reserve interest rates -- both forms of \u201cprinting money\u201d -- boost economic growth and create jobs.\nThere are two ways the government can increase budget deficits: tax cuts and spending hikes. Progressives tend to favor spending projects, like building infrastructure and boosting safety-net programs, which they argue spur demand more effectively by getting money to the ordinary workers most likely to spend it right away.\u00a0And borrowing is typically a great deal during a downturn, when interest rates are low.\nBut the fundamental goal of both tax cuts and stimulus spending is the same: ratcheting up demand at a time when consumers would otherwise be pulling back from the economy all at once.\nThen, when the job market reaches a saturation point and incomes cannot get much higher, those same budget deficits can become a problem. In that scenario, the government crowds out private sector investment, driving interest rates up throughout the economy. (An extreme version of that may have driven hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, but one way or another, the distressed African country is not an apt point of comparison for wealthy developed nations.)Trump seemed to appreciate that concept in a Wednesday interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d in which he doubled down on the \u201cking of debt\u201d moniker. (Although, as with most of Trump's statements, it was not entirely clear what he meant.)\nAn economic downturn, he said, \u201ccould be a good time to borrow and pay off debt, borrow debt, make longer-term debt.\u201d\nTrump has even claimed he will enact a massive infrastructure initiative to \u201ccreate the biggest economic boom in this country since the New Deal.\u201d\nDan Alpert, managing partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital and author of The Age of Oversupply, a book calling for massive fiscal stimulus, expressed alarm that his views on debt might be closer to Trump\u2019s than Clinton\u2019s.\n\u201cThis is a problem, of course. Yes, Donald Trump is on the record advocating borrowing at low rates to pay for infrastructure programs,\u201d Alpert said. \u201cAnd Hillary Clinton is sounding like she\u2019s with the Peterson Foundation!\u201d\nAlpert\u2019s metaphor is telling in its own right. The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the nonprofit of Wall Street billionaire Pete Peterson, for years has been one of the biggest forces behind the conventional wisdom in Washington that reducing the national debt should be the country\u2019s top priority.\nVoices like those coming out of the Peterson Foundation proved decisive in the first two years of the Obama administration, when the White House was eager to assuage public outrage over the rising debt, much of which had shot up organically as a result of the worst recession in decades.Whether out of genuine agreement or political expedience, Democrats acquiesced to the narrative that fiscal stimulus should take a back seat to cutting spending and raising taxes. President Barack Obama's most dramatic gesture in this direction was convening the Bowles-Simpson debt reduction commission in February 2010, long before Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives.\nThe political window for additional fiscal stimulus closed in subsequent years as Republicans in Congress obstructed Obama\u2019s agenda, routinely bringing government to a halt to extract larger spending cuts.\u00a0Pivoting to deficit reduction too soon, a wide array of economists say, limited the economic recovery.\nOne of those economists is former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, a Republican. Bernanke said in April that the spending cuts due to sequestration and other measures had a markedly negative impact on the economy.\nThere are still not enough jobs to raise workers\u2019 pay significantly. While the official unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, it does not account for the high number of people who have given up looking for work.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, inflation and interest rates have stayed very low by historic standards, belying budget hawks\u2019 warnings that they would skyrocket.\nGiven Republicans' stiff political opposition, it is not clear that the Obama administration could have changed this outcome even if it had fought harder for additional fiscal stimulus.\nBut progressives in particular wish the White House at least would have tried to explain why debt can be good in certain circumstances. That way the public might know better the next time the economy took a turn for the worst.\n\u201cEven though most economists thought we needed more stimulus, it is still not a politically accepted point,\" said Josh Bivens, research and policy director of the progressive Economic Policy Institute. \"We are going to enter the next recession, whenever it comes, without that consensus that of course we need to do stimulus.\u201d\nBivens hopes Clinton and other Democrats do not make the same mistake this time around, even as he understands how hard it can be to communicate the virtues of budget deficits to a wary electorate.\n\u201cI wish Clinton had differentiated the two states of the world better and didn\u2019t rely on what are pretty standard tropes about fiscal rectitude,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThen again, I have the luxury of not running for office.\u201d\nEditor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton\u2019s Attacks On Donald Trump\u2019s Economic Policy Could Backfire"}
