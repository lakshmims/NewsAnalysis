That out of many, we are one.\"\nOther advocates echoed the idea that the inn is part of U.S. history.\n\"There are places in America so powerful, they helped shape our nation\u2019s history and culture, and must never be forgotten,\" Theresa Pierno, president of the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. \"Stonewall Inn, and the area surrounding this historic site, is one such place.\"\n\"LGBT history is American history, and it\u2019s vital for our stories to be told and retold and remembered,\u201d said Tim Gill, co-chair of Gill Foundation, an LGBT philanthropic organization that advocated for Stonewall\u2019s inclusion and funded a study on potential LGBT historic sites for the park service.\u00a0\"The designation of Stonewall today helps to ensure that legacy for generations to come.\u201d\nAn announcement about the monument\u00a0has been expected for some time, and comes ahead of the 47th anniversary of the uprising and the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage throughout the country. It also comes nearly two weeks after a mass shooting at gay club in Orlando, Florida, left 49 people dead and brought new attention to violence against LBGT people.\n\u201cThere is no better time to acknowledge Stonewall as a national monument -- a place that is central to our history and our values, not only as a city but as a nation,\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.\nThe new monument protects 7.7 acres of land in Greenwich Village, including the inn, Christopher Park and surrounding streets and sidewalks, the White House said.\n\"Although the LGBT civil rights movement has made significant progress in the pursuit of equal rights and protections under the law, there is still more work to do,\" the White House said in a statement referring the recent attack in Florida. \"LGBT people of color are especially at risk. The Administration is committed to continuing the fight for dignity, acceptance and equal rights for all Americans \u2014 no matter who they are or who they love.\"\nThis article has been updated to include comment from Tim Gill.", "title": "Obama Designates New National Monument At Stonewall Inn"}
