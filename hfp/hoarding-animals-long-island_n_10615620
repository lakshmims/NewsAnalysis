The mammals included rabbits, chinchillas, sugar gliders, prairie dogs, and even a skunk, CBS New York reported.\u201cThe first time we were here, he was given the opportunity to clean up the house, which he did,\u201d Gary Rogers of the Nassau County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told Newsday. \u201cWe returned again just recently and found that the conditions had deteriorated once again.\u201d\nAt that point, Rogers said, the SPCA reached out to prosecutors to intervene.\nIn a statement, the Nassau County District Attorney\u2019s Office described the resulting seizures as \u201ca massive undertaking\u201d by its Animal Crimes Unit. It noted that the effort followed unsuccessful \u201cpeaceable attempts to diffuse the situation\u201d by the SPCA.Rogers said there was no excuse for the sickening scene they found.\n\u201cBesides living in filth, besides living in dirty water, there is a lack of wholesome, fresh, sanitary, healthy air,\u201d he told CBS. \u201cThe odor was horrible. They were living in conditions that were totally unwarranted.\u201d\nGruber\u00a0struggled to care for the animals after his health deteriorated,\u00a0his attorney Nathan DeCorpo told Newsday. The lawyer said that many of the animals are healthy and that Gruber may ask for some of them back.\nIf so, they would rejoin the six cats and some dogs\u00a0that the authorities did not take Tuesday.\nAll of the animals removed will be sent to places \u201cthat deal with animals that were put in these kinds of environments,\u201d Rogers told CBS.", "title": "418 Birds, Turtles, Prairie Dogs, Even A Skunk, Removed From Long Island Home"}
