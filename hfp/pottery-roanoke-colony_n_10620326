To archaeologists, \"a single piece is as good as a whole pot.\u201dDeetz hopes the pottery will shed a little more light on the colonists who vanished in the late 1580s, sparking one of the greatest American mysteries.\nThe colonists had only been residing in the area for a short time when its governor, John White, went back to England for supplies only to find his settlement completely deserted when he returned.\nAbout 100 years passed before any other Europeans moved onto the same land, Deetz said.\nBecause of the pottery\u2019s style and location, he said it\u2019s relatively easy to pinpoint the find to the lost colony.\u201cThere's no doubt that those pieces of pottery are from that time period,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe pottery itself is a type of pottery which is a tin-glaze,\u201d he said. \"This form was pretty much only used between the 1570s and 1620s,\" he added.\nHe was amazed that the artifacts had survived all these years.\u00a0There have been similar shards of pottery found at the historic site, but because of their size they were almost impossible to classify outside of being identified as European, he said.\u201cIt's the type of pottery that wouldn't have an old shelf life,\u201d he said.\nThough the recently found pieces are quite small, Deetz said they\u2019re large enough \u201cto give me the size and the shape and the form of the pot.\u201d\nThe pottery pieces have since been sent out of state for further tests and documentation. Once they\u2019re returned, they\u2019ll likely go on display in the park\u2019s welcome center, Deetz said.", "title": "Archaeologists Say They Made A 16th-Century Find At The Lost Roanoke Colony Site"}
