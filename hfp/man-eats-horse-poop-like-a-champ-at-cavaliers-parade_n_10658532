He then tosses a clump into the air and catches it in his mouth as if it were a gum drop. Observers are both repelled and entertained, just as we are frankly.\nWhile we can't confirm the provenance of said manure, some Twitter users who said they were there insisted it was real poop from a real horse's ass.\nWarning: This video is disgusting (duh):The late drag queen Divine earned notoriety for reportedly\u00a0eating dog feces\u00a0for real in the 1972 John Waters film \"Pink Flamingos.\"\nWho knows what fame and fortune or total embarrassment await this fellow.", "title": "Cavaliers Fan Appears To Eat Horse Poop At Victory Parade"}
