While a similar feature was spotted by Voyager 2 in 1989, this was the first one seen on the planet in the 21st century.\n\"Neptune's dark vortices have exhibited surprising diversity over the years, in terms of size, shape and stability (they meander in latitude, and sometimes speed up or slow down),\" the space agency said.\u00a0\"They also come and go on much shorter timescales compared to similar anticyclones seen on Jupiter; large storms on Jupiter evolve over decades.\"\nAlso on Thursday, NASA announced that it had extended Hubble's science operations for another five years -- until 2021.\n\"After the final space shuttle servicing mission to the telescope in 2009, Hubble is better than ever,\" NASA said.\u00a0\"Hubble is expected to continue to provide valuable data into the 2020\u2019s, securing its place in history as an outstanding general purpose observatory in areas ranging from our solar system to the distant universe.\"", "title": "Neptune's Massive New 'Dark Vortex' Is As Big As The United States"}
