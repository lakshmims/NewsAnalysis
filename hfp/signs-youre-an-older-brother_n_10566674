And if you're the older brother, you know you're in a league of your own. Below are several science-backed signs you're the big bro, through and through.1. You're protective.\nNo one messes with your kid brother or sister and gets away with it.\nBeing protective of your younger sibling comes with the territory of being an older brother -- and that can be a very good thing.\u00a0A 2007 study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry\u00a0found that positive relationships between siblings had a protective effect and were an\u00a0\"important source of support\" for families. In other words, the closer your relationship, the more supportive you are of one another.\n2. You're a little intense.\nBeing an older brother often comes with high expectations. Eldest children have a tendency to be a little hard on themselves while putting an emphasis on traditional achievement.\nThe oldest sibling in a family is often seen as more accountable\u00a0and the one who is\u00a0most likely to conform.\u00a0A 2008 study found that parents are more strict with the oldest child, relying on them to be the responsible ones.\n3. You're a leader.\nFirstborn children often naturally assume a position of leadership\u00a0within a family, taking on the role of an authority figure\u00a0for their younger siblings.\nWhat's more, recent research from Harvard Business school suggests that men are more eager for positions of power. Since older brothers fall into both of these categories, they are likely to become leaders in many areas of life.\n4. You're kind of a genius.\nOr, at the very least, a little smarter than your younger siblings. A 2007 study of 250,000 Norwegian young adults\u00a0found that firstborn men had an average IQ 2.3 points higher than their younger brothers.\n\"Every time you add a child, you\u2019re diluting the intellectual environment of everyone in the family,\" the researchers wrote in the study\u2019s conclusion.\nWay to go, smarty.\n5. You're probably the\u00a0\"successful\" one.\nOlder brothers may have an advantage in both the academic and professional worlds. Oldest children statistically do better in school and are more likely to succeed in business.\nAnd even if you aren't winning at life just yet, researchers have found that parents are more likely to\u00a0perceive oldest children as successful. So when all else fails, at least your mom thinks you're great.\n6. You have a big influence on your younger siblings.\nBeing an older brother comes with plenty of responsibility, especially when it comes to influencing the rest of your family.\nFor example, studies have shown that younger siblings are significantly more likely to smoke\u00a0if their older siblings have done so.\u00a0However, this influence can also have a positive effect too. An older sibling's success has been shown to have a \"spillover effect\" for younger siblings, which can boost their performance.\nYour parents may have raised you, but your\u00a0siblings play a big part in shaping you. After all, for most of us, it's the longest relationship we'll have in life.", "title": "6 Science-Backed Signs You're An Older Brother"}
