He led the campaign to remain in the EU, which was defeated Thursday by 52 percent to 48 percent.\n\"The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision,\" Obama said in a statement. \"The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom\u2019s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of U.S. foreign, security, and economic policy. So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.\"\nHillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, also said in a statement that she respected the results of the referendum and wanted to limit the economic uncertainty\u00a0that the vote had created.\n\"We respect the choice the people of the United Kingdom have made,\" the former Secretary of State said in the statement. \"Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.\"\nClinton added the global uncertainty made it clearer that the United States needed someone with strong experience as president. She has attacked Donald Trump, her Republican rival, as lacking the the temperament and judgement to lead -- something the businessman himself put on full display Friday, when he congratulated the Scottish people for \"taking their country back\" from the EU. Most voters in Scotland backed the \"remain\" campaign.\u00a0Trump said earlier this week he supported Britain leaving the EU\u00a0--\u00a0even though he didn't know that much about the Brexit debate.\nBoth Obama and Clinton had previously urged the U.K. to remain in the EU.\u00a0The president said during a visit to England in April that the nation's membership of the socio-economic union only made it stronger. Some critics at the time argued that the president was interfering in British affairs by voicing his opinion.\nObama also warned that the United States would negotiate a trade deal with the EU members before negotiating one with Britain if the country severed ties.", "title": "Obama Says U.S. Respects Britain's Decision To Leave EU"}
