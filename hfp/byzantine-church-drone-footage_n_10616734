And within such a historic edifice, the project carried an added layer of stress.\u00a0\n\"We had room to fly it, but I knew that it could go wrong at anytime,\" Juin told Fstoppers. \"Just two seconds of distraction could lead to catastrophe.\"\nLuckily the filmmakers surmounted the challenge without a hitch, and the result is breathtaking. We suggest watching with the sound on for a fully immersive experience.\nCheck out BigFly's \"Byzantine\" above.", "title": "Fly Through A Byzantine Church With Breathtaking Drone Footage"}
