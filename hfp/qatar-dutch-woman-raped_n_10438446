She was arrested on March 14, and had been held since then on unclear charges.\nHasan has acknowledged having sex with the woman, but said it had been consensual, according to Dutch media reports.\nSince the case emerged this week, hundreds of sympathizers on Twitter have called for her release and criticized the Qatari reaction to her allegations.\nIt is an offense to drink alcohol or be drunk in public in Qatar, although alcohol is allowed at certain hotels and non-Muslim immigrants can obtain a permit for purchasing alcohol.", "title": "Qatar Deporting Dutch Woman Who Reported She Was Drugged And Raped"}
