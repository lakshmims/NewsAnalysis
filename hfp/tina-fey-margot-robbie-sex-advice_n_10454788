The characters are so hardened to the war around them at this point in the movie that Baker doesn't stop smiling or laughing, even when walking over a presumably dead body being dragged across the floor.\nWatch the clip above, which can also be found on the digital release of \"Foxtrot,\" available Tuesday.\u00a0", "title": "Margot Robbie Gives Tina Fey Sex Advice In Deleted 'Whiskey Tango Foxtrot' Scene"}
