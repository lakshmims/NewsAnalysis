The researchers also examined data on air pollution levels in these four counties (the counties were Stockholm, V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland, Sk\u00e5ne and V\u00e4sterbotten). [11 New Warning Signs Help Spot Mental Illness in Children]\nThe researchers found that the higher the levels of air pollution, the higher the rate of medications dispensed for psychiatric conditions in children and teens. Specifically, the rate of medications increased by 9 percent with every 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in nitrogen dioxide.\nThe new findings add to previous research that has shown links between air pollution and anxiety, perceived levels of stress and mental health conditions in the general population, the researchers said in their study, published June 3 in the journal BMJ Open.\nIt is not clear how air pollution may affect people's mental health, but it could be that air pollution leads to\u00a0inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn may contribute to mental health problems, the researchers said. Some research has also suggested that the brain is vulnerable to ambient particulate matter in polluted air, the researchers said.\nHowever, the new study does not show that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between air pollution and psychiatric disorders, said Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. [5 Controversial Mental Health Treatments]\nThe association between increased pollution levels and increased levels of dispensed medications for such disorders could also have been explained by other factors such as the high prevalence of the mood disorder called seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden, he said.\nMore research is needed to rule out other factors that could be behind the link shown in the study, Horovitz told Live Science.\nOriginally published on Live Science.\nEditor's Recommendations\n\n9 DIY Ways to Improve Your Mental Health\n8 Tips for Parents of Teens with Depression\n9 Weird Ways Kids Can Get Hurt\n\nCopyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company.
