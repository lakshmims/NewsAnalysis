And that\u2019s largely because of low\u00a0crop yields.\nFor many years, the prevailing perception has been that organic farming \u2014 which avoids synthetic pesticides or fertilizers, antibiotics and GMOs, and aims to preserve natural resources and biodiversity \u2014 cannot produce the sort of yields needed to provide food for the world\u2019s population.\nWhile a new report from researchers at the Friends of the Earth admits that crop yields are, on average, currently smaller with organic farming than industrial\u00a0farming, that doesn\u2019t have to be the case.\u00a0\nThe report, released Tuesday by the D.C.-based environmental advocacy group, goes on to argue that crop yields shouldn\u2019t be the only metric by which we should evaluate any given crop\u2019s success.\nIn a conference call Tuesday, John Reganold, a professor of soil science and agroecology at Washington State University, said a crop\u2019s yield is just one of four metrics by which it should be considered sustainably productive.\nEqually important, he argued, is whether a crop is environmentally safe, economically viable to the farmer and socially responsible \u2014 by paying its workers well, for example.\n\u201cFor any farm to be sustainable, it must meet each and every one of these four sustainability criteria,\u201d Reganold said by phone Tuesday.\nWhen organic farming practices are compared to conventional practices using all four of those metrics, the FOE report argues, the organic practices hold an advantage considering their resilience to increasingly pressing agricultural challenges, including climate change and water scarcity.\n\u201cIncreasing the proportion of agriculture that uses sustainable, organic methods of farming is not a choice, it\u2019s a necessity,\u201d Claire Kremen, a conservation biology professor at University of California at Berkeley, writes in the report.\u00a0The report addresses another belief the organization characterizes as a myth \u2014 that increased food production is needed to feed the growing world.\nResearch published in the Journal of Sustainable Agriculture\u00a0in 2012 found that the world\u2019s farmers already produce enough food to feed 10 billion people. The Economist reported similar findings in a 2011 report.\nDespite that tremendous productivity, an estimated 795 million people on earth \u2014 about one in nine people \u2014 do not have enough food to lead healthy, active lives, according to the U.N.\u2019s World Food Programme.\nThe reason for that gap, according to\u00a0World Hunger: 10 Myths\u00a0author and Small Planet Institute director Frances Moore Lappe, is that hunger has less to do with supply and more to do with poverty and a lack of equal access to land, water and other necessary resources.\nThus, any solution to the problem would also need to address these issues\u00a0--\u00a0but Moore Lappe argued conventional agriculture only exacerbates them. As an example of this, the report cited the poverty wages to immigrant farm workers, an estimated 67 percent of whom rely on some form of government assistance.\n\u201cThe real root of hunger is a scarcity of democracy,\u201d Moore Lappe said Tuesday.\nSo what\u2019s the fix? Even though sales of organic foods are on the climb, organic farming still only represents about 0.7 percent\u00a0of U.S.\u00a0farms \u2014 so there\u2019s a long way to go toward these practices becoming more mainstream. In order to get there, the report suggested U.S. policymakers increase their spending on research, education and technical assistance for organic farmers.\nWhile the USDA did increase its spending in this area in 2014, researchers argue it is not enough to keep pace with consumer demand as organic farms look to expand their operations and impact.", "title": "Organic Farming Could Feed The World, If Only We Would Let It"}
