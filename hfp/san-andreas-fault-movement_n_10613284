This new analysis is significant because it's showing motion that wasn't physically identified until now.\u00a0\"While the San Andreas GPS data has been publicly available for more than a decade, the vertical component of the measurements had largely been ignored in tectonic investigations because of difficulties in interpreting the noisy data,\" said lead author Samuel Howell,\u00a0a researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.\u00a0\n\"Using this technique,\" Howell said, \"we were able to break down the noisy signals to isolate a simple vertical motion pattern that curiously straddled the San Andreas fault.\"\u00a0\nScientists say it's crucial to monitor the San Andreas Fault because of its potential to unleash a catastrophic event on the West Coast. Past studies have shown that the fault system is currently at a \"sufficient stress level for an earthquake of magnitude greater than 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale to occur.\"\nThat sort of earthquake would mean mass devastation.\nWhat's more, the San Andreas Fault is connected to another incredibly dangerous fault line, the Cascadia subduction zone.\u00a0\n\"If the entire zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2,\" the journalist Kathryn Schulz wrote in\u00a0a Pulitzer Prize-winning New Yorker article\u00a0last year. \"That\u2019s the very big one.\"\nAs Howell points out, though, \"it's pretty much impossible to say\" when that might happen.\nIf all goes well, the new findings on the San Andreas Fault will let scientists use smaller lobes of vertical motion to predict more significant ruptures, as indicated in\u00a0the journal Nature Geosciences.\nUnconvinced this could mean disaster to come? Well, you could be making a seismic mistake.\u00a0Be careful out there.", "title": "The San Andreas Fault Is Definitely Showing Signs Of Large-Scale Movement"}
