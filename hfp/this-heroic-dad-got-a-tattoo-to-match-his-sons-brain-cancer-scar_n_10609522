It\u2019s really weird,\u201d Marshall told The Huffington Post. \u201cBut it\u2019s raising awareness for childhood cancer, and that\u2019s all that really matters.\u201d\u00a0In March 2015, Gabriel was diagnosed with a form of cancer called anaplastic astrocytoma, a rare malignant brain tumor. The boy, now 8, underwent surgery to have the tumor removed and was left with a scar on the right side of his head. According to a Facebook post by Gabriel\u2019s mom, \u200eBethany Shultz, the scar made her son feel \u201cself conscious.\u201dSo Marshall decided to get a matching scar tattooed in the same spot on his head.\n\u201cI told [Gabriel] if people wanted to stare, they could stare at both of us,\u201d Marshall told Buzzfeed.\nOn Father\u2019s Day, Marshall decided to enter St. Baldrick\u2019s Foundation\u2019s #BestBaldDad competition -- a contest that takes submissions from dads, uncles and grandfathers who have shaved their head in a show of solidarity for a child who has had cancer.\nMarshall entered the snapshot of him and Gabriel snuggling as they show off their matching scars:\u201cGot my son's scar tattooed to help his self confidence,\u201d Marshall\u2019s June 10 entry reads.\n\u201cThank you for your entry. That's really sweet of you to tattoo his scar,\u201d the foundation said in its response to Marshall.\nOn June 19, St. Baldrick\u2019s Foundation announced that Marshall had won first place with 5,000 votes.Since Marshall's big win, his photo with Gabriel has been shared all over social media.\u00a0According to his dad, Gabriel is thrilled by their new viral fame.\n\"He feels really happy and excited,\u201d Marshall told HuffPost.\nYet, despite all the attention, Marshall remains humble, posting on Facebook after his win:\n\u201cI would like to thank everyone for helping make this happen it's an honor to be titled 2016's \u202a#\u200eBestBaldDad, but the truth is I'm no better then any of the other contestants. We are all great fathers that would go to any extent to help our children, so in my eyes we're all winners! Hope you all have a great week and a happy father's day to all you men making a difference in your children's lives!\u201d\nMarshall has started a GoFundMe page\u00a0to help cover his son's medical bills.
