Goodson was also indicted for second-degree assault, misconduct in office, reckless endangerment and three counts of manslaughter. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.\nOne of the prosecution's major arguments hinged on the failure to buckle Gray\u2019s seatbelt -- a mistake that, arguably, caused Gray to suffer a spinal cord injury similar to those seen in high-speed car crashes.\nDuring opening statements in the trial, the prosecutor in the case, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow, maintained that Goodson was at fault for Gray's injuries, The Baltimore Sun reported. Schatzow told the court that Gray was \"injured because he got a 'rough ride'\" due to \"the way the officer transported him.\"\nBut Judge Barry Williams, who was presiding,\u00a0said the state failed to prove Goodson had malicious intentions. \u00a0\n\u201cIn order for there to be a conviction, the state must show, not that the defendant failed to do an act required by the duties of his office, but that the defendant corruptly failed to do an act required by the duties of his office,\u201d Williams said in his verdict.William Murphy, the attorney representing Gray's family, said during a press conference Thursday evening that \"they hope for justice, whatever that is.\"\nMurphy advocated for an open-court system, which would allow cameras into the courtroom. He says this move would ease the anger surrounding the cases since observers wouldn\u2019t have to \u201cwonder about whether the verdict was a just verdict.\u201d\nOn April 12, 2015, Gray was arrested and suffered a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody. He died on April 19, triggering citywide protests against police brutality. After Gray\u2019s funeral on April 27, the unrest escalated and residents looted stores, set fires and threw rocks at police lines.\nGoodson, who is the third of six officers to stand trial in connection to Gray\u2019s death, opted for a bench trial. Officer Edward Nero, who also elected a bench trial, was cleared on all charges last month.\u00a0Baltimore Police Officer William Porter was the first to stand trial in December, but the jury could not reach a verdict.\nBaltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, who faced backlash for her handling of the protests that followed Gray's death, released a statement asking residents to \"continue to respect the judicial process and ruling of the court.\"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said in a statement that he\u00a0\"continues to respect the legal process, as well as the court\u2019s decision.\"\nBut Rashad Robinson, executive director of the activist organization Color Of Change, said the verdict was nonsensical.\n\u201cIt\u2019s preposterous that Freddie Gray\u2019s death was ruled a homicide, but not a single person has been held responsible. Acquitting Officer Goodson -- who gave Gray the 'rough ride' that led to his death -- sends a clear message to Black communities that the police and larger justice system are not designed to protect us,\u201d he said in an email.\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking that Freddie Gray, his family and the people of Baltimore were once again denied justice today,\u201d Robinson added. \u201cBut, we\u2019ll honor Gray\u2019s memory by continuing to fight in Baltimore and across the country to break the vicious cycle of police violence against Black communities in our country.\u201d\nBaltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis also weighed in, saying he is \"pleased by the peaceful manner\" residents have shown. Davis also pointed out the number of formal and informal changes made by the department since Gray's death.\n\"The Baltimore Police Department has taken many progressive steps to improve over the last year. We will continue to adopt and implement policing practices consistent with the expectations of our community,\u201d Davis said in a statement. \u201cWe all have a leadership role to play at this moment. Thank you for doing your part to sustain the momentum of our ongoing progress.\"\nBaltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has come under scrutiny for the lack of convictions in all the cases that have been tried so far. Some legal observers are even suggesting that Mosby drop the charges against the remaining officers. But criminal defense attorney Barry Slotnick, who has been following the case, says Mosby has no choice but to proceed.\n\n\u201cThey brought a case where various defendants have been found to be involved and now there is a need for the trial and those trials are going to happen; they won\u2019t drop the charges of this highly emotional case,\u201d Slotnick told The Huffington Post. \u201cThere are just too many issues involved and I don\u2019t think the prosecution can drop the charges. I think they\u2019re stuck, but I don\u2019t think that anyone is going to be convicted in the end.\u201d\nMurphy, the attorney for Gray's family, said they support Mosby \u201cbecause they believe she is fighting for a just cause.\u201d\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said that Judge Williams had been fair throughout the cases but that he understands residents' frustration with the verdict.\n\n\"I understand those emotions. But we must continue to channel our energies into efforts to improve our city for all residents, and continue to improve our police department's practices and procedures to ensure that the policing of our streets is conducted professionally, safely, and fairly in all parts of our city,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cBaltimore's future does not rest on the outcomes of the trials surrounding Mr. Freddie Gray's death. Baltimore's future rests on every one of us.\"\nThis article has been updated to include details of the verdict and statements from elected officials and from William Murphy.\u00a0", "title": "Baltimore Police Officer Charged With Murder Of Freddie Gray Is Cleared"}
