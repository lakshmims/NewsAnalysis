U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said Trump's response made him \"unnerved.\"\nHillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trump's rhetoric had grown \"even more inflammatory\" in recent days. She said the United States counts on partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism.\n\"Not one of Donald Trump's reckless ideas would have saved a single life in Orlando,\" Clinton said at an event for U.S. military families in Virginia.\nTrump on Monday proposed that the United States suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is \"a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.\" He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amidst a flood of refugees and \"trying to take over our children.\"\nTrump previously has drawn criticism, including from within his own party, for saying he would implement a database to keep track of Muslims in the United States and require them to register.\nTrump's hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists, and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist.\nEditor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "Trump Calls For Surveillance Of Mosques"}
