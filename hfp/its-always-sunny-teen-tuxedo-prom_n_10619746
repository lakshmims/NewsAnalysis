Now what?\u00a0\nThat was the very question faced by Pennsylvanian teen Aniya Wolf, who was dismissed from her high school prom\u00a0in May for wearing a suit that violated the school\u2019s antiquated dress code.\u00a0\nWolf, who identifies as a lesbian and prefers to wear traditionally masculine clothing, was notified before the event that, in the eyes of the school, her choice of dress was unacceptable. She chose to attend the prom anyway.\u00a0\n\u201cI was always more masculine,\" Wolf told ABC27 News\u00a0at the time. \"You wouldn\u2019t catch me playing with any Barbie dolls, I\u2019ll tell you that right now.\u201d\u00a0\nHer story quickly went viral, drawing the ire and attention of activists and celebrities alike who were angered by the the school's discriminatory policies.\u00a0\nThe creator of the FXX series \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\" Rob McElhenney, was one of many moved by the teen's story. But he took it one step further when he invited Wolf to make a guest appearance on the series as the ultimate F-U to school administrators apparently unaware that it is 2016.\u00a0\n\"Aniya, I love your suit. Would u like to wear it on Sunny?\u201d McElhenney wrote to Wolf on Twitter in May.\u00a0Wolf quickly responded to McElhenney's tweet to make sure he wasn't joking, but, for once, the comedy writer/actor was dead serious.\u00a0Now, Entertainment Tonight confirms that Wolf is set to appear on the series this summer in an act of solidarity with the LGBT community.\u00a0\n\u201cInstead of just the kids in the school being able to see the suit, I\u2019d like the whole nation to get to see it,\u201d McElhenney explained to ET.\u00a0\n\u201cWe go to Philly in a couple weeks and we're going to meet her there, and we're really excited,\u201d McElhenney's \"Always Sunny\" co-star, Kaitlin Olson, said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I'm excited to see her suit!\u201d\nWolf will reportedly travel to Philadelphia at the end of June to film scenes in the suit, ET reports, bringing the tuxedo ordeal full circle.\u00a0\n\u201cWe embrace everybody,\u201d Danny DeVito added. \u201cDoesn't matter if you're wearing a tuxedo, jockey shorts, underwear, you don't wear underwear ... What's the big deal? We're people!\u201d", "title": "Teen Kicked Out Of Prom For Tuxedo To Laugh It Up On 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia'"}
