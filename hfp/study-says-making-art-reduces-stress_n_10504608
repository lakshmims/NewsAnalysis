But, no matter. Honestly, it does not matter. Science says so.\u00a0\nMore specifically,\u00a0Girija Kaimal, assistant professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, says so. Kaimal recently led a study examining the effects of making art on stress-related hormones in your body.\nThe results, published in Art Therapy: Journal of the American Art Therapy Association, titled \"Reduction of Cortisol Levels and Participants\u2019 Responses Following Art Making,\"\u00a0found that 45 minutes of creative activity significantly lessens stress in the body, regardless of artistic experience or talent.\n\"It was surprising, and it also wasn\u2019t,\" Kaimal\u00a0explained to Drexel Now. \"It wasn\u2019t surprising because that\u2019s the core idea in art therapy: Everyone is creative and can be expressive in the visual arts when working in a supportive setting. That said, I did expect that perhaps the effects would be stronger for those with prior experience.\"\nThe study, co-authored by Kendra Ray, a doctoral student under Kaimal, and Juan Muniz, an assistant teaching professor in the department of nutrition sciences, invited 39 adults, ranging from 18 to 59 years old, to participate. Markers, paper, clay and collage materials were amongst the tools offered up to the participants, who were instructed to create whatever they so pleased over the course of 45 minutes, with no further directives. An art therapist was on site in case the participants had any questions or concerns.\u00a0\nBefore the crafting commenced, researchers recorded the cortisol levels of the study participants. Cortisol is a biological indicator correlated to stress -- the higher your cortisol level is, the more stressed out you probably are. The participants also described their artistic experience prior to the study. Just under half described their art background as \"limited.\"\u00a0\nAfter the very scientific craft party, researchers again tested the participants' cortisol levels. Approximately 75 percent of the participants displayed lower levels of cortisol, indicating lower stress levels.\u00a0Although the exact amount of cortisol varied slightly amongst the participators, these levels did not correspond to their prior experience in the arts. Nor did they correspond with the artistic media the participants opted to work with, as Kaimal briefly suspected.\u00a0\nThere was, however, a consistent correlation between younger participants and lowered cortisol levels, indicating that young people in particular could benefit greatly from the de-stressing powers of art. \"I think one reason might be that younger people are developmentally still figuring out ways to deal with stress and challenges, while older individuals -- just from having lived life and being older -- might have more strategies to problem-solve and manage stress more effectively,\" Kaimal hypothesized.\u00a0\nIn the future, Kaimal hopes to repeat the admittedly small study and test for additional biomarkers such as alpha amylase and oxytocin to get a fuller picture of the participants' inner states before and after therapeutic art-making.\u00a0\nIn the meantime, though, Kaimal's results confirm what art junkies around the world know very well: Making art is actually, factually, good for the body, mind and soul. Even if said art resembles the deranged scribbles of a grumpy toddler.\u00a0", "title": "Study Says Making Art Reduces Stress, Even If You Kind Of Suck At It"}
