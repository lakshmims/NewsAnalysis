But not so much when it comes to vexillology.\nOn Sunday,\u00a0Facebook users in the Philippines saw a message commemorating the country's declaration of independence from Spain on June 12, 1898. The message, however, had one teensy glitch.\u00a0The issue, as you can see from the tweets, is that the flag in Facebook's image was upside down. The Philippine flag ordinarily looks like this:\u00a0Making matters worse is that under Philippine law, the flag is only flown inverted (with the blue on the bottom) during times of war. Whoops!\nLuckily, Facebook realized its error fairly quickly and apologized.\u00a0\n\"This was unintentional, and we're sorry,\" the company told The Philippine Star. \"We care deeply about the community in the Philippines and, in an attempt to connect people on Independence Day, we made a mistake.\"\nBetter luck next time, guys.", "title": "Oops! Facebook Accidentally Told The World That The Philippines Was At War"}
