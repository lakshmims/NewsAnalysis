On Wednesday it will say its latest review found \"no conclusive evidence for a carcinogenic effect.\"\nAt the same time, however, it will say other scientific evidence suggests that drinking anything very hot -- around 65 degrees Celsius (149 Fahrenheit) or above -- including water, coffee, tea and other beverages, probably does cause cancer of the esophagus.\nLyon-based IARC, which last year prompted headlines worldwide by saying processed meat can cause cancer, reached its conclusions after reviewing more than 1,000 scientific studies in humans and animals. There was inadequate evidence for coffee to be classified as either carcinogenic or not carcinogenic.\nIt had previously put coffee as a \"possible carcinogen\" in its 2B category alongside chloroform, lead and many other substances.\nThe U.S. National Coffee Association welcomed the change in IARC's classification as \"great news for coffee drinkers.\"", "title": "WHO Has Great News For Coffee Drinkers -- With One Caveat"}
