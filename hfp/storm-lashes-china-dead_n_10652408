One showed a man who had apparently tried to shield a woman from falling debris; both were dead in a pile of rubble.\nThe worst of the storm seemed to have hit only a limited area, however.\n\"It looks like the tornado only hit very specific places,\" said a Reuters reporter at the site. \"Even nearby villages were fine.\"\nA man broke down in sobs as his 35-year-old son was pulled dead from a pond in Shizhuang town on Friday.\nIn the nearby village of Dalou, tree trunks were snapped, with plates and household items scattered amid rubble, as survivors picked through the debris.\nChinese President Xi Jinping, visiting Uzbekistan, ordered China's cabinet to send a team to oversee relief efforts, Xinhua reported. Premier Li Keqiang urged authorities to speed search and rescue work.\nGCL System Integration Technology Co Ltd <002506.SZ>, a $5-billion solar cell module maker, said a 40,000-sq-m. (430,000-sq-foot) factory it part-owned had collapsed, and it was assessing the damage.\nEnvironmental campaign group Greenpeace said the storm caused the collapse of a GCL facility used to store hazardous chemicals, located near a drinking water plant and a river.\n\"The release of these chemicals could pose significant risk to public health and the local ecosystem,\" Greenpeace said in a statement.\nChina's summer often brings severe weather. Floods in the south this week killed at least 22 people and left 20 missing.\nLast June, a storm caused a Yangtze River cruise ship to capsize, killing 442 people and leaving just 12 survivors, in one of China's worst such disasters in seven decades.\n\u00a0\n(Reporting by Reuters television in YANCHENG and John Ruwitch and Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Editing by Michael Perry and Clarence Fernandez)", "title": "Deadly Storm Lashes Eastern China"}
