The rapper was actually referring to his \"Khalifa kush.\"\"He apologized,\" Wiz said. \"I wouldn't necessarily say it's squashed though, because when you see him talk about it, it doesn't add up to what he said to me on the phone, so I just don't even.\"\nKhalifa didn't offer much when asked about the infamous feud, but when probed by one of the hosts, he admitted,\"Do I like him? Who would in that situation?\"\nThe Taylor Gang rapper went on to discuss his ex-wife Amber Rose, saying that there will always be love between the two. He blamed the institution of marriage for the demise of their relationship.\u00a0\n\"It's just the relationship part. It's not easy to just be like, oh, I get along with this person so we're married, that s**t takes years we didn't take that time,\" he said. \"As far as the marriage goes, that s**t is over, but us still building and getting to know each other, that's gonna last forever.\"\nWhen asked about Rose's infamous tweet to Kanye West, posted below for reference, Khalifa said he thought it was hilarious.\n\"I was crying!\" he said.\u00a0Though they spoke after to clear the air, it's unlikely we'll ever see a collaboration from Rose's two former flames.\n\"There are certain things you say and certain things you don't' say,\" Wiz explained. \"He's one of them people who's like, 'I just wanna get my point across,' so I'm like, that's cool, but it's all about how you get your point across. That was more my message.\"", "title": "Wiz Khalifa Has No 'Mercy' For Kanye West After Twitter Battle"}
