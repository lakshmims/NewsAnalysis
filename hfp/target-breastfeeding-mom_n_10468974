(He's wearing an Avon shirt).\u00a0\nBefore the video started rolling he looked at me and said (very angrily), \"can't you do that somewhere else?... That's f***ing disgusting.. You are nasty\" (he said a few other things under his breath) I responded with, \"I am feeding my baby, and I have the right to do it here...walk the f*** away..leave me the f*** alone\" He responded with, (as he's walking closer and closer to me and getting louder) \"you are f***ing disgusting...you are f***ing disgusting...you are f***ing disgusting...you whore\" he said a bunch more bullshit that I can not remember ....by this point EVERYONE came to my defense! Target staff and shoppers... Then I started rolling the camera....\"\n\nAs Maher was defending right to breastfeed, a few Target employees came into the cafeteria, as well as another customer who was livid at the man's actions.\nThe man then demanded a refund because he was offended by a woman breastfeeding in public.\nThe unidentified woman customer can be heard comforting Maher and chastising the angry man.\n\"You shouldn't be ashamed of feeding your baby,\" she tells Maher. \"He can go the other way. This is a beautiful moment. If he doesn't like it he can go.\" Then she addresses the man: \"Then don't look, okay? I'm here to protect her.\"\nThe man then apparently left the store, followed by a Target employee.\nMaher said she appreciates the way Target employees and customers responded.\n\"The amount of people coming at me to defend me was amazing,\" Maher told WFSB.com. \"Everyone that was right in that area was there for me defending me, so it felt really good.\"\u00a0Maher's Facebook video has been seen more than 3 million times. So far, no one has publicly identified the man who accosted her.\nMaher said making the video public was the best way to spread awareness about the trials that women face when breastfeeding in public.\n\"The only way we are going to eradicate this behavior is to put it out there and show this is happening,\" she told the Hartford Courant. \"It's unacceptable that a peaceful woman, especially with all the stuff that has been going on, the awful hatred going around, this man thought it was okay to attack a peaceful women feeding her baby.\"\n\u00a0", "title": "Target Employees Defend Breastfeeding Mom From Angry Man"}
