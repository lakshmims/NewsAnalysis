Referred to in court documents as one of the brand's best-known and best-selling models, Wild Thing\u00a0retails for $785.\u00a0Trump's \"Hettie\" shoe, above right, retails for $145\u00a0and does bear a striking resemblance to its pricier predecessor.\u00a0\nIn court filings, Aquazzura said it previously complained to Trump about two other shoes that bear stark similarities to their \"Forever Marilyn\" and \"Belgravia\" designs, including photos of both versions.\u00a0Matthew Burris, CFO of Marc Fisher, said in a statement to The Huffington Post Wednesday that the lawsuit is \"aimed at generating publicity.\"\n\"[The Hettie shoe] is representative of a trending fashion style, is not subject to intellectual property law protection and there are similar styles made by several major brands,\" he said. \"The lawsuit is without merit and we will vigorously defend ourselves against the claim.\"\nCopyright infringement suits\u00a0similar to this one have peppered the footwear and fashion fields.\u00a0Industry giant Steve Madden has settled with at least two luxury footwear brands over similar-looking designs,\u00a0and who could forget the painfully long squabble between Christian Louboutin and YSL regarding the right to a red sole? As\u00a0fast fashion\u00a0brands regularly produce\u00a0less expensive versions of high-end items, labels are fighting back.\u00a0\nAquazzura's founding designer Edgardo Osorio\u00a0started fighting back on social media well before the lawsuit was filed. A quick perusal of his Instagram shows his disdain for Trump's practices started as long as 15 weeks ago, if not earlier.But Osorio was quick to point out\u00a0his problem is with the industry, not Trump personally, as he explained to Footwear News in May.\u00a0\n\u201cI have nothing against Ivanka Trump,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not only her, and I\u2019m glad to [call others out on Instagram also]. I plan to do the same with Steve Madden and other people who have ripped us off....\u00a0Sometimes I look at the buys in department stores, and I see copies of my shoes. We need to be harder with our retailers. They need to protect us. You can\u2019t cannibalize one business with another.\"\nAquazzura didn\u2019t return a request for comment by the time of publication, but we have a feeling Trump and the rest of the shoe industry will be hearing from them\u00a0-- and their counsel -- for a while.\u00a0", "title": "Ivanka Trump Sued For Allegedly Copying Shoe Designs"}
