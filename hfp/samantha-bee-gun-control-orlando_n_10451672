How love wins, how love conquers hate. And that is great, that is beautiful. But you know what? Fuck it! I am too angry for that. Love does not win, unless we start loving each other enough to fix our fucking problems.\u201d\nBee went on to rail against the country\u2019s lax gun control laws, lambasted Florida Governor Rick Scott\u2019s toothless reaction to the tragedy and called for the ban of automatic weapons.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t constitutionally get rid of all guns, but can\u2019t we get semiautomatic assault rifles out of the hands of civilians?\u201d she asked.\u00a0\u201c\u2018Sam Bee wants to take your guns away!\u2019 Yes -- the ones that mow down a roomful of people in seconds. Yes, I do want to take those guns away.\u201d\n\u201cThese high-capacity penis substitutes are a shitty choice for hunting and home protection, but perfect for portable mayhem,\u201d Bee added.\nThere is, ultimately, no shortage of people eager to commit these atrocities, said Bee, and \u201cwe are making it far too easy for their derangement to kill us.\u201d As a nation, the United States needs to \u201cfind the political will to reject a mass shooting per day as the price of freedom,\u201d she stressed.\nWatch the entire segment in the video above.\n\nRead more on the Orlando Shooting:\nCelebrities And Politicians React To Mass Shooting At Queer Orlando Nightclub\nBlood Donors Needed After Orlando Gay Club Shooting, But Queer Men Are Banned\nCongress Is \u2018Complicit\u2019 In Orlando Slaughter, Senator Says\nBarack Obama On Orlando Shooting: \u2018We Will Not Give In To Fear\u2019\nPulse Nightclub Was A Lifeline For Orlando\u2019s LGBTQ Community\nJames Corden Opens Tony Awards With Powerful Message To Orlando Shooter\nOrlando Vigils Around The World Fight Hate With Love, Unity\n", "title": "Samantha Bee Reacts To Orlando Massacre With Powerful Gun Control Message"}
