And after a tragedy like Sunday\u2019s mass shooting in Orlando, that\u2019s completely normal.\nIt\u2019s true for those both intimately and\u00a0more distantly\u00a0connected to the tragedy. But why?\n\"To sleep, we need to be in a state where we are calm, our minds are not too active and we are able to let down our guard,\" Philip Gehrman, assistant professor of psychology in the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine, told The Huffington Post. But that is often not how we feel after a tragedy or disaster. We watch the news. We start thinking about the news.\n\"Our minds are very active and we start to feel less secure,\" Gehrman explained. \"And because you're not letting down your guard, it's harder to go to sleep.\"\nEveryone reacts differently, but a lot of people feel fear and anxiety after major disasters -- even if you\u2019re not physically near where the events occurred or don't have a personal link, said Steve Orma, a clinical psychologist and author of Stop Worrying and Go to Sleep: How to Put Insomnia to Bed for Good. \u201cAnd when you have fear and anxiety,\" he added, \"you\u2019re not going to be able to relax enough to go to sleep.\u201d\nYour body goes into \u201cfight or flight\u201d mode because the body reads the anxiety you feel as a real danger, Orma said. The brain signals to the adrenal glands for a dose of adrenaline and norepinephrine. Your heart rate increases. Blood rushes to your extremities. Orma says those stress hormones are the body\u2019s way of delivering an extra surge of energy.\u201cIt\u2019s the complete opposite state you need to be in to go to sleep. You can\u2019t sleep if you\u2019re in that state,\u201d he said, explaining that while anxiety is an emotion, stress resulting from that emotion is a physical pressure on the body.\u00a0\nBecause anxiety is often triggered by our own thoughts, identifying what\u2019s causing the fear or anxiety that\u2019s disturbing our sleep and addressing is a key step to overcoming it. Here are steps you can take to deal with your worries and start sleeping again:\n1. Talk about what\u2019s bothering you\nA big part of dealing with a tragedy is processing your reactions, Orma said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to suppress those emotions. If you\u2019re sad, allow yourself to cry. If you\u2019re anxious and afraid, say \u2018I\u2019m anxious and afraid.\u2019\u201dTalk to your friends. Talk to your family. For some people, it helps to actually write their worries down, think them through and respond to them, he added. \u201cWhat would you say to a friend if they had these worries?\u201d\n2. Do things that help you relax\nTake a hot bath. Use deep breathing exercises. Get outside. Read an enjoyable book. Watch a TV show or movie that makes you laugh.\nFinding ways to relax will help sleep come more easily.\n3. Don\u2019t change your sleep routines\nIf you\u2019re not a regular nap-taker, don\u2019t start. Avoid sleeping in later than usual on the weekends. Don\u2019t suddenly start taking sleep medications that you can grow dependent on. Having trouble sleeping is not an excuse to pick up poor sleep habits that can actually make it harder for you to fall asleep at night.\n\u201cThose things temporarily will help,\u201d Orma said. \u201cBut they eventually just perpetuate the cycle.\n4.\u00a0Give yourself a break\nIt\u2019s okay to have a few nights of poor sleep. And more importantly, you need to tell yourself it\u2019s ok to have a few nights of poor sleep, Orma said. The more you beat yourself up for not sleeping well and the more upset you get about it, the more anxious you can become about not sleeping and fuel the sleepless cycle.\n\u201cTalk to yourself like you were talking to your best friend or a child. You would talk in a very nurturing, supportive or positive way,\u201d Orma said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t freak them out.5. Get the help you need\nEveryone reacts differently to tragedy,\u00a0and deals with their fears and anxieties differently. And no one timeline fits everyone as far as bouncing back.\nIn general, if your anxiety and sleeplessness affects your ability to function for longer than six weeks though, consider seeking professional help from a doctor or therapist.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to work, if you can\u2019t get out of bed because you\u2019re so scared or depressed, if you\u2019ve stopped eating because you\u2019re not hungry, or if you lose your ability to enjoy life -- and when those things are affected consistently -- that\u2019s when you want to get some help,\u201d Orma said.\nSarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post\u2019s sleep reporter.
