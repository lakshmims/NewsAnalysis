The correct answer is 102. Then watch him gloat that he got 112 under the misguided notion that he outsmarted his children, Ivanka and Donald Jr.\nThis math-block moment hails from a 2006 visit to Howard Stern's radio show, MJ reports. Trump's kids bragged in the clip that their dad couldn't buy their way into Wharton and that they had to earn entry on their own merits.\u00a0\nIt's then that Stern launches the pop quiz. In all fairness, doing even relatively easy multiplication might be tough with an audience. But you'd think at some point that one of the Trumps might come up with the right answer.\nPresident Barack Obama told Jay Leno on \"The Tonight Show\" in 2012 that he was no math wiz either, but we doubt he'd get stumped on 17 x 6.\nEditor\u2019s\u00a0note: Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Fails Math Question, Still Insists He Got It Right"}
