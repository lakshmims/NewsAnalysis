Releasing Tundra, who was born in captivity, into the wild isn\u2019t realistic, zoo spokeswoman Carla Knapp told The Dodo.\u201cThe zoo\u2019s veterinary staff carefully reviewed all of the options and agree that the Detroit Zoo is the perfect facility for Tundra\u2019s needs as a senior bear,\u201d the Indianapolis Zoo wrote in a news release. \u201cConsidered one of the leading polar bear facilities in the world, the Detroit Zoo offers large spaces and pools\u200b with easy slopes for Tundra to enter and exit the water, especially as she gets older.\u201d\u00a0\nThe zoo wrote that while its own polar bear habitat was \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d in 1988, it needs updating, and moving Tundra is in her \u201cbest interest.\u201d It added that she\u2019s currently healthy, and it makes sense to move her now, before she gets any older. She'll be there sometime after June 22.\nAnd now, Tundra won\u2019t be alone. She\u2019ll be joining Talini, a female born at the zoo in 2004, and Nuka, a male who arrived at the zoo in 2011. The Detroit Zoo\u2019s Arctic Ring of Life, where the polar bears live, is four acres in size and includes a 190,000-gallon salt water pool, a fresh water pool and both a pack ice area and a grassy tundra.\u00a0Animal advocates praised the Detroit Zoo in 2005 when it announced that it would be moving its two Asian elephants to a large sanctuary in California, saying that the zoo simply could not provide the amount of room that elephants should have.\n\"We want animals to thrive, not simply survive,\" executive director Ron L. Kagan told The Dodo last month.\nWe certainly hope Tundra thrives there.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story said the Detroit Zoo moved its elephants to a sanctuary last month. It was in 2005.", "title": "Zoo Gives Up Aging Polar Bear To Give Her A Better Life"}
