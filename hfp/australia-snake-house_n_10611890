Not the type to get totally freaked out, she shared a video of the unwanted guest, who is a bit hard to miss.\nWarning: The video contains language appropriate for a large snake, but not necessarily for young audiences.Hibberd named the snake Monty (the python) and called a snake catcher to have him removed.\n\u201cIts frigging huge! Have it locked in bedroom waiting for help......my life is never boring,\u201d Hibberd told friends on Facebook.\nThe snake has lived in Hibberd's home for 10 years and finally \"tried to upgrade to the master bedroom,\"\u00a0the BBC reports.\u201cFirst photo I have of him\u2026was in 2012 but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s been in the roof for a lot longer,\" Hibberd told news.com.au. \"He used to slither down into the pool area for a feed & a drink then slither back up just before sunrise unless he had a tummy full of food & got stuck. Am pretty happy that he\u2019s gone. Snake catcher said he was a kangaroo killer!\u201d\nLuckily, there is a happy ending for Monty.", "title": "Woman Says 'Frigging Huge' Snake Has Lived In Her House For Years"}
