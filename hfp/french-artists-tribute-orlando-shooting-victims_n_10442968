And this angel\u2019s face, which looks like the prow of a ship tracing an arc in the sky, appeared to me,\u201d the artist told HuffPost France. \u201cThe red heart below is the tail of the star; a shooting star that has been pierced by an arrow. I didn't realize that when I drew it. I discovered it once the drawing was done. These things are intuitive, they come naturally to me through emotion.\u201d\nDe Castelbajac also created drawings after the Paris attacks to\u00a0express his pain and show his support for the city.\u00a0\n\u201cThese are shocking things, touching things that affect us all and are taking us to a world of increasing concern,\u201d he said. \n\"I am a father and grandfather, so I'm very concerned with the future of our society,\" he added.\u00a0\"A few days ago, I was in Istanbul for a festival. The day after I arrived, there was an explosion in the city. This threat is so overwhelming because it impacts our most carefree moments.\"\nDespite his fears, the artist said he believes there\u2019s still space for hope. \n\"I am very optimistic, like the colors I use,\" he said. \"I am full of hope, and I believe that solidarity and commitment to a better world will conquer all.\"\u00a0\nSoledad Bravi, who created a cover image for Elle France to pay tribute to those killed in the 2015 shooting at Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices, showed support for the Orlando victims with an illustration of a tearful, rainbow-colored heart.\u00a0The designer Louison, who created both poignant and lighthearted artwork after the Charlie Hebdo attack, posted two illustrations after the Orlando massacre.\u00a0\"In Paris, no one is picking up trash anymore...\"\"...So I'm going to stop drawing it.\"Actress and singer Lou Doillon also posted an image on Sunday night with the caption: \"My heart and thoughts for all.\"\u00a0An illustration by French-Canadian artist Ghyslain Duguay sends a message of resilience.One of the most widely shared graphic so far has been this ribbon accompanied by #JeSuisGay, a hashtag reminiscent of those that emerged after the two attacks in Paris, as well as one that shook Brussels earlier this year.\u00a0This post originally appeared on HuffPost France\u00a0and has been translated into English and edited for clarity.\nDonate to the Pulse Orlando relief fund here:\u00a0\n", "title": "French Artists Pay Tribute To Orlando Shooting Victims"}
