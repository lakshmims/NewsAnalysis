So why not save the whites for something else and make an all-yolk sauce instead?\nAfter hundreds of yolks and much experimentation, the folks at Cook's Science say they've mastered a creamy sauce that's made with just yolks and salt, for you to squeeze over anything and everything.Here's how:\nWhisk egg yolks and salt together, and gently cook at 149 degrees for exactly 32 minutes until the mixture becomes pasteurized (i.e. safe to eat).\u00a0You can either use a sous vide machine or a cooler filled with boiling water.\u00a0For more specifics on exactly how Cook's Science makes it,\u00a0they want you to sign up for updates on their new project.
