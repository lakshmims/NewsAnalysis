Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has beef with the idea of military personnel participating in \u201cmeatless Mondays,\u201d and last week\u00a0introduced amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act\u00a0that would ban the initiative from military cafeterias.\nThe idea of meatless Mondays -- forgoing meat one day a week to promote the health and environmental benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle\u00a0-- has been\u00a0gaining traction throughout the U.S.\u00a0and has earned support from organizations including the Humane Society of the United States.\nThe U.S. military does not currently participate in meatless Monday,\u00a0nor has there been any evidence that any branch intends to enforce it anytime soon. \nThe U.S. Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut started a meat-reduction program several years ago, and recently began working on the initiative with the HSUS. Several veteran-affiliated organizations have embraced the meatless Monday idea in the last few years as well, including the Veterans Health Administration and New York state's Veterans\u2019 Wellness publication. The Norwegian military\u00a0adopted meatless Mondays in 2013. \nBut Ernst wants to make sure there will never be a formal program\u00a0barring Monday meat-eating at U.S. military establishments. She told agricultural consulting business Pro Ag that meatless Mondays are \u201cmisguided,\u201d according to Politico. She contended that \u201cour men and women in uniform should have the option to consume the protein they need, including meat, on a daily basis.\u201d \nHer amendments are scheduled for a vote in the Senate on Tuesday.\nErnst served in the Army Reserve and National Guard for 23 years, and grew up on a farm. Her state is a leader in meat production -- which makes some people question if Ernst\u2019s opposition to meatless Mondays is about a different kind of pork entirely.\n\u201cThis whole issues makes me wonder is Sen. Ernst is putting Iowa agribusiness interests over our interest in our military,\u201d Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm-animal protection for HSUS, told The Huffington Post. \nErnst received almost $200,000 from agribusinesses\u00a0during her 2014 senatorial campaign. \nErnst cites the 2015 federal dietary guidelines to support her argument that members of the military need meat-based options to fulfill their daily protein requirements. However, those dietary guidelines contradict themselves when it comes to recommending how much meat a person should eat. \nThey do not explicitly limit a person\u2019s daily recommended amount of red meat or processed meat, but they do point out that lower meat consumption is associated with a reduced risk of\u00a0cardiovascular disease.\nThe Coast Guard Academy has cut its meat consumption by 10 percent in the last three years but began officially collaborating with HSUS last year, according to Shapiro. The organization paired up with the academy\u2019s executive chef, Michael Cummins, to create meals with meat alternatives: For example, substituting beans for chicken in burritos and serving spaghetti with marinara sauce instead of meatballs.\u00a0\nMore people making such substitutions could held combat the country's\u00a0\u201ctoo fat to fight\u201d issue, Shapiro suggested\u00a0-- currently,\u00a01 in 3 young people in the U.S. are reportedly too heavy to serve in the military.\nA plant-based diet is often cheaper\u00a0than one that's meat-based, so practicing meatless Mondays could have financial benefits as well, Shapiro said. \nShapiro is skeptical that Ernst\u2019s amendments will pass the Senate, although he was hesitant to make any predictions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s bad to predict, but I think that this is such a wacky proposal that I have a feeling that it won\u2019t go far,\" he said.\u00a0\nErnst\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. \u00a0\nUPDATE:\u00a06.14 --\u00a0The Senate did not vote on Ernst's meat amendment\u00a0Tuesday, but did pass the NDAA by a vote of 85 to 13.", "title": "Iowa Senator Doesn\u2019t Want Anyone Forcing Soldiers To Eat Vegetables"}
