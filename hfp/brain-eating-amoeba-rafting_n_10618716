The amoeba can infect the brain by entering a person\u2019s nose.It\u2019s unclear where Seitz contracted the amoeba, but Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials are testing the water at the U.S. National Whitewater Center\u00a0in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Columbus Dispatch reports. Seitz went rafting there on June 8 with a church youth music group. Her raft overturned, which could have sent water containing the amoeba up her nose.\nOther people who were in the raft with her haven't fallen ill.\nDr. Marcus Plescia, the health department director for Mecklenburg County \u2014 where the whitewater center is located \u2014 told the Charlotte Observer the center is \u201cas safe as any body of water,\u201d and noted there are \u201cthings \u2026 that can cause illnesses\u201d in any lake or pond. Nevertheless, officials treated the water there with chlorine.\nSeitz\u2019s obituary described her as music lover who cared deeply about others:\n\nLauren understood the overwhelming beauty and fragility of life with uncommon clarity and cared so deeply about the welfare of other people and this world we all share. Her genuine kindness and encouragement will continue to inspire and comfort everyone who knew her.\n\nSeitz graduated from Westerville South High School in May, and had planned to study environmental science, with a minor in music, at Denison University in Ohio.\nInfections from naegleria fowleri are rare, but nearly always fatal. Only 138 people were diagnosed with the infection from 1962 to 2015, and only three survived. Symptoms include sudden fever, headache, vomiting or a stiff neck.\nThe CDC writes that people should \u201cassume that naegleria fowleri is present in warm freshwater across the United States\u201d and avoid getting that water up their nose. People who have recently been in warm freshwater and are experiencing infection symptoms should get medical care immediately.", "title": "Teen Dies Of Brain-Eating Amoeba After Whitewater Rafting Trip"}
