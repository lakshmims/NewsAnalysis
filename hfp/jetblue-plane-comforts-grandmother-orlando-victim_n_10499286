And gratitude,\"\u00a0Karas said.\nAirline employees walked the grandmother to her seat and helped her settle in, Karas wrote. They offered her a blanket, pillow, water and a box of tissues for her tears.\nAs the attendants took drink orders mid-flight, Karas passed around pieces of paper to passengers for them to sign as makeshift condolence cards.\nThat's when the roughly one-hour flight \"got truly inspiring,\" Karas wrote.Passengers didn't just sign their names on the papers,\u00a0as Karas had expected. They wrote pages filled with love and condolences for Ocasio-Capo's grandmother.\n\"There were even a couple of cash donations and more than a few tears,\" Karas said.\nWhen the plane landed, Karas ended the standard flight announcements with a touching declaration. \"We stand with Orlando,\" she told the passengers.\nThen, with permission from the grandmother, the entire plane had a moment of silence in honor of her grandson.\nAs the passengers left the plane, they each left Ocasio-Capo's grandmother with another act of kindness.\n\"EVERY SINGLE PERSON STOPPED TO OFFER HER THEIR CONDOLENCES,\" Karas wrote in her Facebook post:\n\nSome just said they were sorry, some touched her hand, some hugged her, some cried with her. But every single person stopped to speak to her, and not a single person was impatient at the slower deplaning process.\n\nWhile JetBlue is\u00a0offering free flights for the Orlando victims' families and domestic partners, airline spokesman Rick Clark told The Huffington Post that the extra treatment Ocasio-Capo's grandmother received wasn't planned. Clark was unable to disclose the passenger's name.\n\"It was the organic act of kindness from the crew,\" Clark told HuffPost, adding that the flight attendants organized everything on their own.\nKaras said in her Facebook post she was grateful for the passengers' show of support.\n\"I am moved to tears yet again as I struggle to put our experience into words,\" she wrote.\n\"In spite of a few hateful, broken human beings in this world ... people ARE kind. People DO care. And through our customers' humanity today, and through the generosity of this wonderful company I am so grateful to work for, I am hopeful that someday soon we can rally together to make the world a safer place for all.\"Find out how to help the Orlando victims and their families here, or you can donate below.", "title": "Entire JetBlue Flight Comforts Orlando Victim's Grandmother In The Most Beautiful Way"}
