The trial is taking place in Nashville and is expected to last up to six days, prosecutors have said.\nProsecutors have said the victim in the case, which drew national attention to sexual assaults on college campuses, had been drinking with friends and then with Vandenburg.\nVandenburg and teammate Cory Batey, two of four former Vanderbilt football players charged with counts of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery, were found guilty in January 2015 in the first trial.\nDefense attorneys had argued Vandenburg and Batey should be found innocent because Batey was too drunk to make a conscious decision about his actions, and Vandenburg was too intoxicated to commit an assault.\nJudge Monte Watkins declared a mistrial in June 2015 and set aside the convictions because one of the jurors had failed to disclose he himself had been a victim of rape. The men were assigned separate retrials.\nBatey was convicted again in April, and sentencing was scheduled for July 13. Aggravated rape carries a prison sentence of 15 to 25 years. His attorneys have said they plan to appeal.\nThe trials of the other accused former football players, Jaborian \"Tip\" McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to be held after Vandenburg's retrial.\n\u00a0\n(Reporting by Tim Ghianni; Editing by Ben Klayman and Cynthia Osterman)", "title": "Prosecutor In Rape Trial: Ex-Vanderbilt Football Player 'Violated The Laws Of Human Decency'"}
