Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), who hosted the reading, called the victim's letter \"gut-wrenching.\"\n\"The sexual predator received a paltry sentence of six months in country jail, of which he will serve only three, for committing a violent crime,\" Speier said.\n\"We are not moved by the felon's excuse of alcohol. We are not moved by the judge, who said a longer sentence would have a 'severe impact' on the offender. We are not moved by the felon's father, who said that his son should not serve jail time for '20 minutes of action.'\n\"Emily Doe is a survivor in every sense of the word,\" Speier added. \"And her words deserve to be amplified.\"\u00a0Two graduate students spotted Turner assaulting the\u00a0unconscious woman behind a dumpster on Stanford's campus in January 2015. A jury convicted Turner\u00a0of three felony sexual assault charges\u00a0in March. Instead of the six-year prison term requested by prosecutors, a judge sentenced Turner to six months.\u00a0\nThe victim's\u00a012-page letter, an expanded version of what she read to Turner during his sentencing on June 2, has been viewed more than 6 million times on BuzzFeed.\u00a0\n\"Your Honor, if it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly,\" the woman\u2019s statement begins. \"You don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\"\nThe act of reading the woman's statement on the House floor means that her words will be entered into the congressional record, making them an official, documented part of American history.\nIt's the first time a sexual assault victim's impact statement has been read in Congress, according to Speier's office.\nIn an interview with The Huffington Post last week, Speier said reading the statement aloud is \"a symbolic act that underscores the gravity of the offense.\"\n\"I hope that by reading it into the record, by elevating this issue, that we\u2019re going to take some steps to provide leadership on the federal level to address sexual assault on campus and in the military,\" Speier said.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version gave the wrong date of the Stanford sexual assault. It occurred in January 2015, not July.\nRelated Coverage:\n\nIf Not For 2 Strangers, Brock Turner May Have Never Been Arrested\nHow A Stanford Student Accused Of Assaulting Multiple Women Graduated\nCNN Host Lets Sexual Assault Victim\u2019s Powerful Statement Speak For Itself\nLet\u2019s Not Ignore The Importance Of Brock Turner\u2019s Whiteness\nThe Heroes Who Stopped Brock Turner Don\u2019t Want This To Be About Them\nStanford Has A Trust Problem When It Comes To Sexual Assault\nBrock Turner\u2019s Dad Gave Tone-Deaf Plea For Lenient Sentence In Son\u2019s Sexual Assault Case\n", "title": "Watch Members Of Congress Read Stanford Rape Victim's Full Statement"}
