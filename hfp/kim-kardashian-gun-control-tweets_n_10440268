They scare me so much,\u201d Kim said at the session,\u00a0adding, \u201cI\u2019m not really a gun person, and we do not have strict enough gun control laws.\u201d\nThe \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" star echoed that sentiment in August with another series of tweets. She asked followers if they'd heard of David Conley, a man who allegedly murdered his ex-girlfriend Valerie Jackson\u00a0along with her common-law husband, Dwayne Jackson, and six children with a gun purchased online.Kim's continued push for gun control represents a more socially conscious side of the reality star.
