I carried one in Iraq. They have no place on America's streets. #Orlando\n\nDespite Moultan\u2019s sound argument, gun rights advocates are determined to maintain the laws that protect their access to these weapons of war.\nOmar Mateen, 29, used a MCX Sig Sauer, which he purchased legally.\u00a0\nAssault rifles are typically the gun of choice of assailants who wage mass shootings.Adam Lanza used an AR-15-style Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle to murder 20 children and six adults in 2012 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\u00a0Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik also used assault rifles to carry out the shooting in San Bernardino in December, which left 14 dead.\nIt makes sense considering the weapon\u2019s capacity.\nInitially invented in the 1950s by firearms engineer Eugene Stoner, the ArmaLite Rifle was branded as a lightweight firearm with precision accuracy and high lethality at long range.\nThey fire off bullets quickly. So quickly that an experienced shooter could fire many as\u00a045 rounds\u00a0in a minute.Yet, despite its lethality \u2013- and popularity among mass murderers -- assault rifles remain readily available and nearly immune from policy change.\nTwo days after the nightclub shooting, it took two HuffPost editors 38 minutes to purchase an AR-15, a gun similar to Mateen's, at a store in Orlando. This, despite the fact that the city was under a state of emergency following the attack.\nThe salesman told HuffPost that it would typically take five minutes. But because of the surge in sales following the shooting, which is pretty standard, the queue for background checks was longer than usual. \u00a0\nWhile President Barack Obama has called for bans on such guns, the general public isn\u2019t all that interested in seeing one passed.\nAccording to a December Washington Post/ABC News poll, 45 percent of those surveyed said they want to see assault rifles banned. That\u2019s down from 80 percent in 1994.\u00a0\nAnd courts continue to side with gun rights advocates on this issue.\nIn February, for example, a federal appeals court ruled that a ban in Maryland on specific kinds of semi-automatic firearms was unconstitutional.\u00a0\nOutlawing such firearms would \u201csubstantially burden this fundamental right\u201d to bear arms, Chief Judge Traxler wrote in his ruling.\u00a0\nProtecting gun rights over actual human lives spurred the Onion, a satirical news outlet, to write a letter of thanks from the perspective of an assault rifle on Tuesday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just want to reiterate how truly grateful I am to the millions of you out there who regularly jump into action at the merest suggestion that any human life might be more valuable than I am, and who stand up proudly and say, 'No, this particular device is far, far more important than someone\u2019s child, than someone\u2019s spouse, than someone\u2019s parent.' And after last weekend, I know I can count on you to do the same again.\"\n", "title": "Iraq Vet: 'I Know Assault Rifles. They Have No Place On America's Streets'"}
