Her mother,\u00a0Marcia, identifies as straight, but opted to stay committed to Trisha throughout her transition and beyond.\u00a0\n\"Growing up, all I wanted was to be from a 'normal' family,\" Shattuck told People last year. \"But now, I'm grateful that my family is different. It's made me more compassionate toward other people's differences.\" \u00a0\nSlated to air on PBS's documentary film showcase POV in October, \"From This Day Forward\" has already enjoyed great success on the festival circuit, and was an official 2015 selection at Outfest in Los Angeles, San Francisco's Frameline and the Camden International Film Festival.\u00a0\nDon't miss a sneak peek at \"From This Day Forward\" above.\u00a0", "title": "This New Film Looks At What Happens When A Parent Transitions"}
