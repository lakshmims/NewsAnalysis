She has already circulated a letter to her 111 fellow members of the Convention Rules Committee urging them to support her proposed \u201cconscience clause\u201d to let delegates out of their obligation to vote for Trump.\nUnruh told participants on a conference call Sunday that she believes that if they can persuade a majority of the rules committee to approve her proposal, a majority of the full convention would likely follow suit --\u00a0and Trump would lose the nomination.\n\u201cOur strength comes from the delegates themselves,\u201d Unruh said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re saving the party.\u201d\nTrump, though, still has the support of Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus and his staff, who downplay the delegate revolt. They highlight Trump\u2019s Wednesday speech, which was cheered by many Republicans because Trump largely stuck to his prepared remarks by reading off a Teleprompter. He accused Clinton of a variety of misdeeds but did not, for example, ad lib attacks on the federal judge handling a class action fraud lawsuit against Trump University, his series of real estate seminars.\nOne source close to the Trump campaign said the departure of volatile campaign manager Corey Lewandowski would prove to be a turning point. Lewandowski had jealously guarded his access to Trump and had worked to undermine top strategist Paul Manafort, who has been trying to fashion Trump into a more conventional candidate since he joined the campaign in March.\n\u201cThe consistently erratic nature of this campaign is over,\u201d the source said.\nRepublicans not in the Trump orbit, though, remained skeptical. \u201cHe had one good day because he didn\u2019t vomit all over himself and gave a decent speech,\u201d said GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak, but allowed that it was at least a start. \u201cIs he in a better place than he was last weekend? Yes.\u201d\nMackowiak and other Republicans said a major problem continues to be Trump\u2019s unwillingness or inability to raise the amount of money needed to compete with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton --\u00a0notwithstanding Trump\u2019s claims that his fundraising has increased dramatically in recent weeks.\n\u201cThe July report, I think, will show you some pretty massive numbers,\u201d Trump said Friday at a news conference from Scotland.\nThose bullish claims, though, follow similar claims that a May 25 Los Angeles fundraiser had brought in $6 million. But when the May report was released early this week, it showed Trump\u2019s \u201cVictory\u201d fund had only transferred $3.1 million to the Republican National Committee --\u00a0the entity that receives the vast majority of the fund\u2019s money.\n\u201cIt's part of his fabulous mentality. If his car is 20 feet long, he's going to say it's 22. He can't help it. He thinks 22 is a better number,\u201d said one RNC member and donor.\nHe said the lack of money is already having consequences.\u00a0A delay in hiring field staff in key states that was announced at the April RNC meeting in Florida has largely continued, he said, costing both Trump and other Republicans on the ballot valuable time. Staff members who were recruited and ready to go on the payroll remain in limbo, he said. \u201cBecause many of them are smart, many of them are getting real jobs, and they\u2019re not even available now,\u201d he added. \u201cThe money\u2019s just not there.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\n", "title": "Only One Thing Stopped Donald Trump's Week From Being A Complete Disaster"}
