Still, the chorus pushed for an early release so that proceeds from sales of the song could be donated to LGBT advocacy groups Equality Florida Action, Inc. and Galop.\n\"The course of LGBT history throughout the U.K. and the world has changed so significantly in the last 25 years,\" Peake, who is one of over 200 members of the chorus, said. \"Some times were good and other times were horrendously bad.\" The song, he added, was chosen \"to commemorate our combined LGBT history and [show] that we're not alone.\"\nTalk about a stunning tribute.\nDon't miss a clip of the chorus's original June 13 performance of \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" below.\u00a0", "title": "A Gay Take On A Pop Classic Becomes A Rallying Cry For Orlando"}
