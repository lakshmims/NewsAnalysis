In a press conference on Sunday, LeBron James joined the chorus.\u00a0\nBefore he started taking questions during a press conference in the lead-up to Game 5 of the NBA Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers star shared his thoughts and prayers with the victims of the shooting.\n\"My condolences go out to all the lost ones and families in the tragic shooting,\" James said.\u00a0\"It's another hit for us as Americans and what we have to deal with in our world today, and it definitely puts things in perspective on basketball for myself; it's just a small matter of what reality really is.\"\nThis is not the first time LeBron has spoken out against gun violence. Back in October, he spoke out against the shooting of a 5-month-old girl\u00a0in Cleveland by posting this on his Twitter:Following his Twitter posts,\u00a0ESPN asked LeBron what lead him to share his thoughts. LeBron said,\u00a0\"It's the quickest way to get my voice out there, first of all, social media ... Obviously it's not the first time that it's happened, but it's been happening a little bit too much recently ... It's just, there's no room for that.\"\nDuring the 2014-2015 NBA season, LeBron took part in multiple social protests regarding gun violence in our country. We saw LeBron stand up for\u00a0Eric Garner by wearing a \"I Can't Breathe\" warm-up jersey\u00a0before a December game against the Brooklyn Nets, and we saw him sport a hoodie with his then Miami Heat teammates to protest the death of Trayvon Martin.\u00a0\nHere are a few ways to help support the victims and their families following Sunday's tragedy.", "title": "LeBron James Says Orlando Shooting Puts Importance Of Sports In Perspective"}
