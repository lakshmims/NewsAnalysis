And as the number of residents swell,\u00a0urban boundaries will expand into the territory of other densely populated areas until entire regions coalesce into super-metropolises, author\u00a0Parag Khanna posits in his new book Connectography.\nKhanna calls these areas \"megacities.\"\u00a0While that\u00a0term is usually used to describe individual cities with populations over 10 million -- of which there are dozens\u00a0around the world, including New York, Mexico City, Beijing and Mumbai --\u00a0Khanna writes that megacities shouldn't just be defined by how many people they hold.\nHe sees future megacities not as individual entities but as clusters linked by advanced infrastructure systems. These clusters, he says, would be major drivers of economic growth.\n\u201cWe should spend time building cities that are viable, connected and stable,\u201d Khanna told The Huffington Post. \"It's about improving livelihoods and infrastructure, and building a path to stability.\"\nIn Connectography, which was published in April,\u00a0Khanna says 40 of these interconnected megacities will form in the next decade, with many concentrated in fast-growing regions in Asia.\nIn the map below, some of these potential megacities are marked by dotted lines. For instance, there's \u201cAbu-Dubai,\u201d a merging of the cities Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. In Japan, there's \u201cTokyo-Osaka.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0In the U.S., a potential megacity in the Northeast would encompass Boston, New York City and Washington, D.C. It would boast a combined population of more than 50 million and would be responsible for a fifth of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, Khanna says. \nOn the West Coast, a megacity cluster would be centered around Silicon Valley and could extend even to Los Angeles.\n\"These city-states matter far more than most American states,\" Khanna writes in his book, \"and connectivity to these urban clusters determines Americans\u2019 long-term economic viability far more than which state they reside in.\"\nA key factor in the growth of these megacities will be extensive transit routes, in particular high-speed railways, says Khanna.\nSuper-fast trains\u00a0already exist in many parts of Asia and Europe and can travel around 200 mph. The U.S. is still playing catch-up: There's a high-speed line that links cities in the Northeast and can reach speeds of 150 mph, and there's a high-speed rail project currently under construction in California, but it's been hit with delays and growing concerns about its budget.\nA lot more can be done, Khanna says, like laying groundwork for more subways, rails and airports.\n\u201cThere needs to be significant investments in infrastructure,\u201d Khanna said.\u00a0\nConnectography\u00a0identifies a number of other regions in the U.S. where high-speed railways might spur a shift toward megacities: in the Great Lakes region, with Chicago connecting to Detroit; in the Southeast, with Atlanta connecting to Raleigh and Nashville; in Texas, with the triangle of Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. Of course, infrastructure isn\u2019t limited to physical routes and transit lines. It\u2019s also about increasing people\u2019s access to online services and information so they can communicate more easily.\n\u201cThe better the bandwidth, the overall phone penetration, the WiFi hotspots, the better the city will be,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cI\u2019m a huge believer in those.\u201d\nAs megacities form and expand, however, inequality will also likely be exacerbated. They will attract top talent and hand them big paychecks. Housing will become less and less affordable. Income stratification will be unavoidable.\nThese things are already happening in expensive cities like New York and San Francisco, where calls for more affordable housing\u00a0continue to grow while office rents hit stratospheric levels.\nIf Khanna's predictions about megacities become a reality, these issues would only become more pronounced.\n\u201cYou can see so much violence, inequality, anti-gentrification movements and labor unrest,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cAll of these are manifestations of large cities being places that empower people to earn more than they could in other places, but have significant inequality and stress.\u201d\n\ufeffCorrection:\ufeff An earlier version of this story omitted San Antonio from the Texas Triangle.", "title": "New York, Boston And D.C.
