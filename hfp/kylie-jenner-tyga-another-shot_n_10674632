Relentless.\u00a0\nThe never-ending Kyga carousel made a quick stop at brother-in-law Kanye West's music video premiere\u00a0in Los Angeles on Friday. Jenner and Tyga were reportedly spotted holding hands\u00a0as they left the venue together, according to People.\u00a0\nAnd honestly, who can blame them?
