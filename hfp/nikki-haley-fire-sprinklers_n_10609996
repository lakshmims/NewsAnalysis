In more than a dozen state capitals from Phoenix to Tallahassee, they had managed to block plans to require fire sprinklers in new homes.\nThen came a threat from a place they thought was buttoned up: South Carolina.\nIt happened hours into a marathon session of the obscure council that sets state building codes. Some of the 15 council members who had gathered at the firefighters academy in the woods outside the state capital of Columbia already left for home. Late into the night, the state\u2019s fire marshal, Adolf Zubia, somehow persuaded a majority of those remaining to support sprinklers by a vote of 6-3.\nZubia hadn\u2019t really expected to prevail. Just as surprised was a spectator in the front row \u2014 Mark Nix, head of the state homebuilders association. The vote posed a threat to his industry. Adding sprinklers could cost builders thousands of dollars per home. California and Maryland already required residential sprinkler systems, but if South Carolina fell, other more conservative states might follow.\u00a0\nNix locked eyes with the fire marshal at the council table. According to Zubia, Nix mouthed a warning: \u201cYou. Are. Fucked.\u201d\nWhile Nix denies saying that, Zubia instantly found himself in hot water. Before the meeting even adjourned, his phone buzzed with a text. He was to report to the office of Gov. Nikki Haley first thing in the morning.\nThere, Zubia says he was pushed to resign, the second state fire marshal forced out by the governor after advocating for sprinklers. And, soon, the code council reversed its decision.\nOver the last eight years, U.S. homebuilders have spent millions of dollars on an extraordinary effort to block a safety improvement that the writers of the nation\u2019s model building codes adamantly insist will save lives. The industry\u2019s campaign, conducted far from the spotlight of Washington, shows how a well-financed lobby can shape state politics in public and behind the scenes.\nThe battle over sprinklers has consequences beyond politics. While house fires have become less common, thanks to smoke detectors and other improvements, modern construction techniques can make new homes more vulnerable to flames than older ones. There is no reliable central source of national data on house fires, but a ProPublica review of state records found two people who died and dozens who were injured in fires involving homes built without sprinklers since the beginning of 2009, after they became a nationally recommended standard.\nTo date, industry groups have helped foil efforts to make sprinkler systems mandatory in at least 25 states. That includes New York, where last year a two-year-old girl died in a blaze that fire officials said could have been stopped by sprinklers, and Texas, where the legislature\u2019s ban was retroactive, overturning at least one city\u2019s plan. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie twice blocked sprinkler rules passed by the legislature. In Minnesota, builders got the state\u2019s code change reversed in court on a technicality.\nA close look at the fight over sprinklers in South Carolina \u2014 according to government records, emails and dozens of interviews \u2014 offers an unusually well-documented portrait of how lobbyists can get their way in state capitals.\nAlong with cultivating allies in the legislature through hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions, the Home Builders Association of South Carolina has relied on a close relationship with the governor. Haley, a rising Republican star who early this election season appeared on lists of possible vice-presidential candidates, was backed by the builders in her campaigns for the state legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion.\nWith Haley\u2019s help, the homebuilders gained sway over the South Carolina Building Codes Council, the prime decision-maker on rules governing the safety of homes and other buildings. The council is supposed to be an independent body balanced among multiple stakeholders, but Haley helped pack it with industry-friendly members, records and emails show.\nIn vetting council appointments, Haley\u2019s aides effectively gave veto power to Nix, the head of the builders\u2019 lobby. In one exchange, a Haley aide checked names with Nix, who wrote back, \u201cHey buddy\u2026 All three guys are good with us.\u201d Haley filled the council seat set aside for a disabled person with a man who was given a house by the trade group as a charitable donation.\nHaley\u2019s spokeswoman, Chaney Adams, said that the governor doesn\u2019t back mandatory sprinklers because she wants \u201cSouth Carolina families to decide what works best in their homes\u201d and that her appointees \u201care all qualified candidates who the governor feels will protect the safety and welfare of the public while, at the same time, defending consumer choice.\u201d\nThe builders lobby wasn\u2019t shy about touting the impact of donations from its political action committee and other tactics. Celebrating a crucial vote on sprinklers in the legislature, the group later distributed a video message to its 3,000 members.\n\u201cWe were majority against us when we started,\u201d Edward Yandle, one of the group\u2019s board members, said in the video. \u201cWith the PAC money, and the ability to get in front of these guys, we won a battle we weren\u2019t supposed to win.\u201d\nNix said that his association has no special influence over Haley\u2019s administration or the legislature. He added that his group\u2019s victories help create jobs and keep housing affordable in South Carolina.\nSprinklers have been commonplace in commercial buildings since the 1950s and in hotels and apartment buildings since the 1990s. Whether they should also be mandatory in new single-family homes and duplexes has been debated for decades, pitting fire departments, sprinkler makers and scientists against builders. The industry\u2019s position has been to leave the decision (and the bill) to homebuyers who want the safety feature, rather than making sprinklers standard in all homes.\nUntil recent years, declining numbers of deaths and injuries from U.S. home fires \u2014 thanks, in part, to codes requiring residential smoke detectors \u2014 blunted the urgency of the argument for sprinklers. In 1980, fires in single-family homes and duplexes caused an estimated 4,175 deaths, not including firefighters, and 16,100 injuries; by 2006, the toll had dropped to 2,155 deaths and 8,800 injuries.\nBut those reductions have stalled in the last decade, amid rising evidence that newer homes are built in ways that make fires burn more intensely.Composite wood beams and other elements that make construction faster and cheaper make homes more vulnerable. Open floor plans remove walls and doors that can slow the spread of a fire and limit its oxygen supply. People in the 1970s typically had about 17 minutes on average to get out before what firefighters call \u201cflashover\u201d \u2014 the moment a room gets so hot everything in it combusts.\n\u201cToday that\u2019s down to three or four,\u201d said John Drengenberg, an engineer at Underwriters Laboratories, a safety consulting company that performs controlled burns to study how fire spreads.\nSuch evidence prompted the members of the International Code Council, a Washington-based nonprofit, to include residential sprinklers in their minimum safety recommendations starting in 2009.\nAt about a couple of dollars per square foot, sprinkler systems add $4,000 to $5,000 to the cost of the average house \u2014 roughly as much as granite kitchen countertops, proponents say. Homeowners can recoup some of that by paying less for insurance; State Farm, for example, offers up to a 10 percent discount on premiums.\nStill, builders contend that requiring sprinklers in all new homes would be enough to price out thousands of potential buyers and squeeze an industry still recovering from the housing bust.\n\u201cEverybody wants safe homes,\u201d said Gerald Howard, head of the National Association of Home Builders, which is based in Washington, represents more than 140,000 members and spends millions each year on campaign donations and lobbying. \u201cEverybody also wants affordable housing. I don\u2019t see the cost effectiveness being there for fire sprinklers.\u201d\nNo independent national studies have definitively calculated how much safer a sprinkler system makes a home. A 2013 review by the National Fire Protection Association found the death rate in homes with sprinklers was 82 percent lower.\nThe group based its projections on four years of fire data collected by the federal government, but its findings were still only estimates because many local jurisdictions don\u2019t report their incidents. The group receives funding from sprinkler manufacturers.\nWhile the homebuilders have fended off rules in almost all the states, dozens of cities have decided to go it alone and add sprinklers to their own building codes. A few did so long before 2009, and their safety records often are cited by sprinkler advocates.\nScottsdale, Ariz., a fast-growing city that had a population of 230,000 in 2014, imposed the mandate in 1986. In a 2001 report, the city said its rate of fire deaths had dropped faster than the nation\u2019s and credited sprinklers with saving 13 lives. The devices also cut the cost of fire damage to an average of about $3,500 for structures with sprinklers, compared with $45,000 for structures without them. Requiring sprinklers didn\u2019t slow home building, the city found, and Scottsdale\u2019s population growth outpaced the state average.\nPrince George\u2019s County, a Washington, D.C., suburb, imposed the rule in 1992. There have been no fire deaths in homes with sprinklers since, while at least 55 people died in fires in one- and two-family homes without them, according to Mark Brady, a spokesman for the county fire department.\nHoward, of the national builders group, said results from any single community should be taken \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d because infrastructure and construction methods vary from place to place, affecting both fires and the costs of preventing them. Without more comprehensive studies, the safety benefits of sprinklers remain unproven, he said.\nNo organization tracks all house fires or records the age of buildings that burn. But using data compiled by the U.S. Fire Administration, county records and information from the real estate website Zillow, ProPublica identified 37 fires that caused injuries in homes built since 2009 in seven states where the sprinkler mandate has been blocked.\nThose fires resulted in two deaths: In May 2015, two-year-old Nora Lamirande died in a fire that raced through a newly built home in Van Buren, N.Y., while in College Station, Texas, a 48-year-old woman was found dead along with her two Rottweilers from smoke inhalation inside a new house. Among the dozens of people injured in such blazes was at least one in South Carolina: Reginald Wright of Anderson, who lost his job as a forklift operator after he suffered severe burns trying to extinguish flames that broke out in May 2015 in the new house he rented.\nSince the 2008 decision by the international commission, roughly 4 million single-family homes and duplexes have been constructed in the U.S., most without sprinklers. These homes will likely never have sprinklers, because retrofitting is so much more expensive than including them in the original construction.\nThere\u2019s no way to precisely measure the potential danger, but the delay worries many fire officials \u2014 even Zubia\u2019s successor as South Carolina fire marshal, Shane Ray, who didn\u2019t push for a sprinkler requirement while in office.\n\u201cIf you were building 1,000 houses a year, and it takes five years to get this, there\u2019s 5,000 houses that don\u2019t have that protection,\u201d said Ray, who after leaving the South Carolina job in 2014 became president of the National Fire Sprinkler Association. \u201cAs the fire chief I had to drive past those houses, I had to go into those houses on medical emergencies and I knew that some day there could be an event there that could cost somebody their life. That\u2019s where this strategy of kicking the can down the road leaves us.\u201d\nWhen South Carolina's code council took up residential sprinklers in 2009, the national battle lines already were drawn.\nThe previous September, builders and firefighters had debated angrily at the annual meeting of the International Code Council in Minneapolis. The council, established in 1994 to standardize building codes across the country, updates its recommendations every three years through a vote of its members, who include industry representatives as well as fire safety officials and building inspectors.\nIn Minneapolis, each side traded accusations that the other had paid for sympathetic members to travel to the convention. In the end, though, the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of sprinklers, 1,282 to 470.\nNormally the council\u2019s recommendations, which cover everything from toilets to garage doors, quickly become part of local rulebooks. This time, the homebuilders vowed to block sprinklers around the country. \u201cI can\u2019t recall any other time where there was such a wide national campaign to remove a provision from the code,\u201d said Sara Yerkes, a vice president of the code organization.\nAs in other state capitals, homebuilders, realtors and developers had an outsized presence in Columbia. They had contributed more than $4.5 million to South Carolina\u2019s politicians and parties during the prior three election cycles, second only to lawyers and law firms, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.\nThe most iconic gathering on the legislative calendar is the Bird Supper, held every spring since 1970 by the Home Builders Association of South Carolina. Lawmakers dine on fried quail, grits and green beans as they mix with members and bid for guided hunting trips. At the dinner, the group bestows its Hammer and Trowel Award on the year\u2019s most builder-friendly legislator, and fetes the winner at an invitation-only gathering for PAC donors.Debate over sprinklers had intensified in 2007 after nine firefighters died fighting a blaze at a giant furniture store in Charleston that had failed to install sprinklers. Fire officials, citing that tragedy as well as a 2004 Greenville motel fire that killed six guests, began pressing for sprinkler laws to be strengthened and expanded to homes.\nAs the state\u2019s code panel considered the matter in 2009, Steven Mungo, then the president of the South Carolina homebuilders\u2019 group, told members in a newsletter that it was time to step up again.\n\u201cOur political clout is largely driven by the number of members we represent and the amount of money we are able to raise,\u201d Mungo wrote. \u201cOur vigilance is all that will stop excessive regulation which sucks all the profitability out of our industry.\u201d\nTo pressure the state code council, builders turned to supporters in the legislature. Two Republican state senators, William O\u2019Dell (who the next year would receive the Hammer and Trowel Award) and Mike Fair (known for fighting to add creationism to the state school curriculum) wrote a letter opposing sprinklers to the code council\u2019s chair, Frank Hodge. Their letter cited a study by a University of South Carolina economics professor asserting that 17,000 families would be priced out of the housing market that year if developers had to add on the cost of sprinkler systems.\nWhat the letter didn\u2019t say was that the faculty member, Joseph Von Nessen, is \u201ca member and ardent supporter\u201d of the builders\u2019 group, as the group\u2019s director referred to him in university emails obtained through a public records request. Von Nessen also works for his father\u2019s marketing company, which has worked for the trade group.\nVon Nessen said in an interview that he calculated the impact on homebuyers at the request of the builders group. He said he took household income data from the U.S. Census, then estimated the number of families at the time who would no longer be able to afford a home if the price of sprinklers were added. He said he stands by the accuracy of the figure he supplied to the builders.\nThe builders\u2019 campaign faltered. Hodge, the code council chairman, was known as a stickler for minimum recommended codes, and the members were receptive to the vociferous arguments in favor of sprinklers made by the state\u2019s fire marshal at the time, John Reich. In February 2010, the builders lost the first round when the code council voted to adopt the sprinkler mandate. The fight moved to the state legislature.\nThe builders plied state lawmakers with materials saying the requirement would result in economic disaster. Their predictions included a $100 million drop in tax revenue and a loss of \u201cmore than 10,000 full time jobs.\u201d They framed the sprinkler requirement not as one of dozens of routine code updates but a \u201cyearly $150+ million tax on homeowners.\u201d\nA group of lawmakers, led by Republican State Rep. Bill Sandifer, chairman of the labor, commerce and industry committee, introduced a bill to remove the code council\u2019s authority to require sprinklers in single-family homes and duplexes.\nSandifer, a one-time Hammer and Trowel winner himself, was pleased to help the builders\u2019 cause. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the stronger groups, they\u2019re highly respected,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is give the homebuilders the tools to ply their trade.\u201d\nSandifer acknowledged that he advised colleagues to discount the international council\u2019s recommendation on sprinklers because \u201cit appears it\u2019s more geared to European countries.\u201d In fact, 99 percent of the group\u2019s members are from the U.S., and Europe has its own code standards. But Sandifer\u2019s argument gave some lawmakers one more reason to overturn the state code council\u2019s action.Nix, the director of the builders\u2019 lobby, took aim at Reich, the fire marshal who was leading the firefighters as they tried to preserve the sprinkler mandate.\nA towering man with a deep Southern baritone, Nix, 48, says he learned much of what he knows about politics by working as a director for the legendary conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr. on his TV talk show, \u201cFiring Line,\u201d in the 1990s. He accused the fire marshal of violating the law by lobbying on state time. He would call Reich\u2019s boss, Adrienne Youmans \u2014 director of the state Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation \u2013 and ask her to force Reich to stand down, according to Reich.\n\u201cIt was a running order: \u2018Get rid of John,\u2019\u201d Reich said in an interview.\nAt one point, Nix filed a public records request for Reich\u2019s emails and other communications, along with those of Reich\u2019s deputy, Sondra Senn, who was also pushing for sprinklers and whose sister had recently died in a house fire. On another occasion, Nix snapped a photo of Reich in the statehouse as the fire marshal was campaigning for the sprinkler requirement. He emailed it to the governor and Reich\u2019s boss.\n\u201cWhile I readily admit that I represent a special interest and lobby with my member\u2019s money,\u201d Nix wrote, \u201cI never expected to have my taxes be used against me and my members to lobby for a mandate.\u201d\nReich said in an interview that then-Gov. Mark Sanford shielded him from the political pressure, believing it was within the scope of his role as fire marshal to help promulgate safety codes.\nWhile Nix worked to undercut Reich, the builders pushed their agenda with lawmakers, continuing to cite the 17,000 lost homebuyers. The trade group spent more than $130,000 lobbying the legislature that year, records show, with in-person meetings, phone calls and emails. Then-Sen. Phil Leventis, a Democrat and one of the strongest advocates of sprinklers, said the blitz focused on those who were least informed.\n\u201cLegislators are people with knowledge a mile wide and an inch deep. That\u2019s easy to exploit,\u201d Leventis said. \u201cAlmost nothing happens inside the chamber without support and approval from outside the chamber. Lobbyists shape what goes on inside.\u201d\nHe said it\u2019s common for lobbyists in the capitol to enlist major employers from lawmakers\u2019 districts to make more tailored solicitations: \u201cThey can bring pressure to bear on someone inside in a way I can\u2019t.\u201d\nThe House voted 89 to 19 in April 2010 to block the sprinkler requirement and ultimately reject the entirety of the code council\u2019s three-year update \u2014 in effect forcing the state to remain on 2006 codes until 2012.\nUpdated codebooks, already printed for local jurisdictions, were never used.\n\u201cHad we been unsuccessful, the economic impact on our industry would have been between $100-200 million each year,\u201d Mungo, the president of the builders\u2019 trade groups told members in a celebratory message.\nEven more important, the new law ensured future fights would be fought on friendlier turf for the builders. Now legislative approval would be required anytime the code council changed the rules for residences. The homebuilders\u2019 newsletter boasted that this would \u201cprevent the inclusion of nefarious code provisions in the future.\u201d\nIn the video distributed to the group\u2019s members, Yandle attributed the success to the amount of money the builders had been able to spread around to lawmakers.\n\u201cThe only way to get the seat at the table is to contribute to their campaigns and they\u2019ll give us an appointment,\u201d Yandle said. \u201cOther than that it\u2019s really hard to get in front of them.\u201d\nMungo urged members in their newsletter to \u201ctake some of that money you will save as a result of this victory and contribute it to the PAC so we can have a significant influence on the upcoming elections.\u201d\nThen Mungo telegraphed the homebuilders\u2019 next target. The sprinkler battle, he said, was only \u201cround one\u201d in a bigger fight against burdensome regulations.\n\u201cLook for significant restructuring of the Building Codes Council in the coming months,\u201d Mungo wrote.\nFive months after\u00a0the anti-sprinkler bill passed, Haley was elected governor, succeeding Sanford. (Sanford had hung on even after it became public that his six-day disappearance in 2009 was due to an extramarital affair and not, as his aides initially claimed, a hike on the Appalachian Trail.)\nHaley\u2019s three successful state house campaigns, from 2004 to 2008, had received more than $23,000 from the home building and real estate industries. In her 2010 gubernatorial bid, developers, homebuilders and realtors gave more than $255,000, making them her top industry donor. (Her Democratic opponent, Vincent Sheheen, got $135,680.) During her first month in office, Haley was feted by the builders and realtors associations at a $100-a-ticket oyster roast fundraiser, held at a private clubhouse along the Saluda River outside Columbia.\nThe new governor moved quickly on matters that pleased the builders. First, she replaced Reich as fire marshal. \u201cWe knew who she was supported by,\u201d Reich said in an interview, referring to the builders association and its leader, Nix. \u201cBy making an example out of me, he silenced a lot of others.\u201d\nThen Haley\u2019s newly created inspector general\u2019s office, as one of its first orders of business, launched an audit of the firefighters association, which had been the prime advocate of sprinklers and a target of the homebuilders. Among other things, the audit questioned whether the group was improperly supporting its lobbying with a stream of public money \u2013 the portion it receives of the 1 percent tax on state fire insurance premiums.\nWhile the audit found no wrongdoing, the group soon halted its aggressive push for a sprinkler mandate. Charles Stewart, who owns one of the largest sprinkler installation businesses in the state, said that after the audit, the group\u2019s director, Joe Palmer, stopped returning his phone calls. Stewart recalled that when he subsequently showed up at Palmer\u2019s office, the director told him why the group had backed off.\n\u201cNo one issue was important enough to jeopardize the 1-percent fund,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hatchet, that\u2019s what they use to manipulate them\u2026He was sad. He knew they got worked. But he said he can\u2019t put the whole organization at risk.\u201d\nPalmer, in an interview, said the audit had nothing to do with the group\u2019s stance. A decision was made to focus on public education after the legislative loss, he said.\nNext, Haley\u2019s administration made changes to the state code council at the behest of the builders, records and interviews show.\nThe governor appoints the members of the council, who are charged with adopting and revising building codes that must be followed across the state. (By statute there are 16 seats, but during some periods slots have been vacant.) One seat is set aside for the homebuilders association; by law the rest are reserved for other stakeholders, including various construction trades, a fire service representative and a member of the public.\nFrank Hodge, who had been the chairman of the council when it voted in favor of sprinklers, was quickly removed. His term was up and Haley didn\u2019t renew it. The homebuilders \u201ctook me off,\u201d Hodge said in an interview. \u201cI knew they were trying to change the complexion of the building code council.\u201d\nBy August 2012, the seat reserved for a physically disabled person was turned over to Brian Denny, a 39-year-old building supply worker from Columbia who had been paralyzed in an on-the-job accident. The homebuilders\u2019 trade group, as part of its charitable work, had built him a new, wheelchair-friendly house that same year. The builders urged Haley to appoint Denny to the code council, according to interviews.\nLloyd Schumann, Denny\u2019s retired predecessor in the designated council seat, described himself as not having been an ally of the builders. \u201cI guess they needed a vote,\u201d Schumann said. He said he was surprised to hear that the builders helped pay for Denny\u2019s house: \u201cThat amazes me, that dumbfounds me. That kind of graft going on.\u201d\nIn an interview, Denny said that while the builders paid for 70 percent of the house, the gift doesn\u2019t affect his judgment on the council. A review of Denny\u2019s financial disclosure forms shows he did not report the gift. He didn\u2019t respond to subsequent messages asking for comment on why it wasn\u2019t included.\nNix said in an interview that the builders had nothing to do with what happened to Reich or Hodge. In the case of Denny\u2019s house, he said, the builders\u2019 role was routine charity work and wasn\u2019t intended to influence the council.\nThen there was the seat set aside for a county official. When Nix learned it was coming open, he asked others in his trade group for recommendations in May 2012, and one member forwarded Nix\u2019s message to Melissa Hopkins, then a plans examiner in Dorchester County. \u201cYes\u2026I would be very interested. Let me know what I would need to do,\u201d Hopkins responded.\nLess than a month later, Hopkins emailed Nix with good news: \u201cGood morning! Just to let you guys know, I received a letter yesterday from Gov. Haley letting me know my spot on the Council was confirmed\u2026Thanks!\u201d\nIn an interview, Hopkins said Haley appointed her because of her record, not because of Nix\u2019s recommendation.\nThe council seat for a municipal administrator went to Curtis Rye, a councilman for the city of Forest Acres. At the time, a company owned by Rye and his wife sold shingles and other supplies to homebuilders and belonged to the homebuilders group. Rye said he is not affected by the group\u2019s lobbying.\nThe council also designates a seat to represent insurers, a group typically in favor of stricter safety codes. Haley in 2012 appointed Frank Norris, a member of the homebuilders association who sells insurance to homebuilders. Nix confirmed he had recommended Norris to Haley\u2019s office.\nNorris would later be inducted into the homebuilders\u2019 hall of fame. The citation for his 2013 award, presented at a Westin resort on Hilton Head Island, noted his \u201cunwavering efforts to protect the home building industry.\u201d Norris did not respond to requests for comment on his relationship with the trade group.\nWith the panel's new lineup, and the 2010 win in the legislature, the homebuilders had little reason to worry about another push to mandate sprinklers. Moreover, Haley\u2019s new fire marshal, Adolf Zubia, said the governor had given him an unmistakable message when she hired him: \u201cYou will never mandate residential sprinklers in the state of South Carolina.\u201d\nYet even as Zubia, a brash native of New Mexico, agreed to that condition, he quietly resolved to set the stage for the code change under a future administration.\nZubia, 58, had been fire chief of the city of Las Cruces and was a past president of the International Code Council, the nonprofit that sets model building standards. He didn\u2019t fit naturally into Columbia\u2019s political culture; at one of the building industry\u2019s iconic Bird Suppers, he walked the buffet line and stopped across from the display of small crispy game birds. \u201cWhat are they serving, fried rats?\u201d Zubia said loudly, one colleague recalled.\nTo Zubia, it was obvious that sprinklers prevent injuries and property damage and that they would someday be universal. He didn\u2019t see himself as deceiving Haley. \u201cIf you have any sense of what is right and wrong, you will do certain things,\u201d Zubia said.\nPushing for any change in the code would run up against the builders, Zubia knew, so he first proposed a compromise with Nix: in lieu of a statewide mandate, the state could leave the matter of residential sprinklers to individual towns and cities.\nNix turned him down. Furthermore, Nix wrote to Zubia, if \u201cspecial interest groups\u201d continued to ask for a mandate, the builders might go a step further and seek to have the state ban sprinklers permanently, according to an email.\nZubia recalled Nix being even more blunt in person, refusing to compromise because the builders had the legislature and the governor \u201cin our pocket\u201d - a statement Nix denied making.\nZubia\u2019s fallback plan was to revisit the statewide sprinkler requirement with the code council. Even though the mandate was certain to be overturned by the legislature, it might give him leverage for a concession from the builders.\nAt the crucial meeting in May 2012, just over half the members of the code council remained by the time of the vote, and several of Haley\u2019s appointees had not yet begun serving. Zubia seized the opportunity to push the sprinkler measure through.\nThat was when Zubia claims that Nix mouthed his pointed warning.\nThe next morning, Haley told Zubia he could remain in her administration only if he backed off his support of sprinklers. Zubia felt he had no choice but to resign.\n\u201cShe\u2019s basically telling you: \u2018Just hang, be nice, don\u2019t say a thing and don\u2019t do a thing,\u2019\u201d Zubia said. \u201cYou can\u2019t work that way.\u201dAt its next meeting, the council rescinded the sprinkler requirement for single-family homes and duplexes. In exchange, the homebuilders did allow a modest concession. Townhomes would be required to have sprinklers, but builders could ignore that rule if they made the firewalls between units a little stronger.\nIn a letter to his staff, Zubia said he was resigning for family reasons, and that\u2019s what South Carolina news outlets reported.\nZubia recalls driving away from the governor\u2019s office, pulling over to call his wife with the news, and weeping. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m not there is very simple,\u201d said Zubia, who is in Nevada now as an assistant fire chief. \u201cThe homebuilders got to her.\u201d\nHaley\u2019s spokeswoman declined to answer questions about Zubia\u2019s ouster.\nAfter their wins, the homebuilders continued to exert influence on Haley\u2019s administration to ensure they wouldn\u2019t have to fight sprinklers again. In October 2014, Katie Philpott, Haley\u2019s director of boards and commissions, wrote to Grant Gillespie, the governor\u2019s director of business and government affairs, about reappointing three members of the state code council. Gillespie forwarded the chain to Nix, then emailed Philpott back with Nix\u2019s answer.\n\u201cHe is good with them,\u201d Gillespie wrote. \u201cSo they are good to reappoint.\u201d\nIn an April 2014 speech, Haley promised homebuilders she would continue to do away with regulations. \u201cAnything that gets in your way that\u2019s my job to stop it,\u201d she said. And this year, the builders association thanked Haley with their Hammer and Trowel award, saying she has been \u201cinstrumental\u201d in passing favorable laws and calling her \u201ca staunch supporter of the home builder agenda.\u201d\nThe builders are now pushing legislation that ensures the state is not bound at all to recommendations written by the International Code Council, leaving safety rules entirely up to the state council instead.\nIn an interview, Nix said things are better in South Carolina now that \u201csome of those characters who were causing those problems are gone.\u201d", "title": "How Nikki Haley Helped Fuel The Homebuilding Industry\u2019s War On Fire Sprinklers"}
