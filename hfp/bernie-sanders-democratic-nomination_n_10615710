Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) acknowledged on Wednesday he did not believe he would be the Democratic nominee for president.\n\"It doesn't appear that I'm going to be the nominee, so I'm not going to be determining the scope of the convention,\" Sanders said during an interview on C-SPAN.\nDuring a video address to supporters last week, Sanders vowed to defeat presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump but has stopped short of dropping out of the race, vowing to press on to the Democratic convention next month.\n\"What we are trying to do is create the most progressive platform that we possibly can, reflecting the needs of working families and students and the environment, health care and so forth,\" he said. \"We are trying to do nothing less than transform the Democratic party.\"\nSanders has called for the ouster of DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the elimination of superdelegates, the adoption of same-day voter registration, and allowing open primaries so voters unaffiliated with a party can help choose its nominee.\nAfter he met with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in Washington last month, Sanders said there was no agreement that he needed to endorse her in order to get a speaking slot at the convention.\n\"I've given a few speeches in my life. It would be nice to speak at the Democratic National Convention,\" he said. \"If they for whatever reason don't want me to speak, you know, so what?\" Sanders added that he expected to speak at the convention.\nSanders said his campaign continued to negotiate with Clinton's and wanted to see her stake out progressive positions.\nThe Vermont independent also said he hadn't spoken with Clinton about any potential running mates.\n\"I think she should select clearly the most progressive candidate she can find. I think it would be a terrible mistake for her to go to a candidate who has roots from Wall Street or who has been backed by Wall Street,\" he said.", "title": "Bernie Sanders: 'It Doesn't Appear That I'm Going To Be The Nominee'"}
