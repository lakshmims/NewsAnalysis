Clinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country \u2014 they enslave women and murder gays.\u00a0I don\u2019t want them in our country.\"\nOmar Mateen, the suspect in the Orlando shooting, was a U.S. citizen born in New York City who reportedly declared his allegiance to the Islamic State militant group before carrying out the massacre -- not a refugee or foreigner who would be affected by Trump's proposed immigration restrictions. There\u2019s no clear evidence that Mateen was acting as part of a larger terrorist network,\u00a0President Barack Obama\u00a0said Monday.\u00a0\nLGBT voters support Clinton over Trump, 84 percent to 16 percent, according to a recent Whitman Insight Strategies survey. Trump has gone on record opposing national marriage equality. Over the weekend, he also assured a conference of Christian conservatives that he stood with them on the matter.\nTrump still has ways to go on his pitch to LGBT voters. In his address, he promised to be a \"better friend\" of the \"LBGT\" community -- a misspeak that may have been caused by his inexperience using a teleprompter.\nChad Griffin, president of Human Rights Campaign, America's largest LGBT civil rights organization, criticized Trump's penchant for antagonizing Americans regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Editor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims \u2014 1.6 billion members of an entire religion \u2014 from entering the U.S.\n\u00a0", "title": "Donald Trump Claims He\u2019s Better For LGBT Americans Than Hillary Clinton"}
