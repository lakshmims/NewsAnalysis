But he's right.\"\u00a0(It's not clear what \"An\" means. Also, Trump seems to be referring to himself in the third person here, not quoting someone else.)\nThe tweet also includes a link to a\u00a0story\u00a0by the Trump-cheerleading site Breitbart. That story claims that a document obtained by Judicial Watch shows that the Obama administration supported the work of al Qaeda in Iraq -- a predecessor to the self-described Islamic State militant group -- as an opponent of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad.\nThe Breitbart story doesn't actually appear to support Trump's claim, as The Guardian notes.\nOn Monday, in the wake of a mass shooting by a terrorist sympathizer in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 people dead, Trump implied that Obama himself was in cahoots with terrorists.\u00a0\n\"Look, we're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind,\" Trump said on Fox News.\u00a0\"And the something else in mind -- you know, people can't believe it. People cannot, they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the way he acts and can't even mention the words 'radical Islamic terrorism.' There's something going on. It's inconceivable. There's something going on.\"\nIn a separate interview Monday, Trump declined to clarify\u00a0what exactly he meant, saying only, \"I'll let people figure that out for themselves.\"\nTrump received a barrage of criticism for his baseless insinuation. Later, he seemed to deny having made it, growing incensed when The Washington Post reported that he had said the thing he said.\nIn response to the Post's writeup of his Monday remarks, Trump put the newspaper on his lengthy media blacklist. (The Huffington Post is already on the blacklist --\u00a0join us!)\nIn separate Facebook posts, Trump criticized the Post's headline and then announced the blacklisting.\u00a0\nSo, to recap: Trump implied that the president sympathizes with terrorists. Then he said it was \"phony and dishonest\" to report that he'd said such a thing. Then,\u00a0he suggested that his original comments were right all along.\u00a0\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar, rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.\n", "title": "Donald Trump Implies He Was Right To Imply That Obama Supports Terrorists"}
