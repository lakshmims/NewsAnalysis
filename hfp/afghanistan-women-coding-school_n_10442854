This marked the start of a catastrophic time for Afghan women\u2019s rights. Under the Taliban\u2019s strict interpretation of Sharia law, women who once attended co-ed schools, worked in offices, drove cars, traveled unaccompanied by men \u2013 and even wore miniskirts \u2013 were forced to stay home and required to wear the burqa.\nIn 2001, the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan released the Taliban\u2019s grip on the country, but the group\u2019s rule had a lasting impact on people\u2019s perception of women\u2019s capabilities. In terms of job opportunities for women, teaching in an all-girls school is a considered respectable option; any field that involves working alongside men is frowned upon.\nBut Forough always knew women were just as capable as men. So, after completing her master\u2019s degree from the Technical University of Berlin, she came home and opened Afghanistan\u2019s first all-female coding school, Code to Inspire\u00a0(CTI).\n\u201cWhen we started recruiting girls in Herat in the fall of 2015, we wanted to show them their value and empower them to break down traditional barriers,\u201d Forough said.\nUnder the eye of the international community and with budding support from the Afghan government, many Afghan women are taking their chance to challenge the social and economic restrictions that the Taliban left behind. Currently, 85 percent of women in Afghanistan are illiterate, with no formal education. But a survey by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) found that 80 percent of Afghan women now have access to mobile technology, either through their own phone or one belonging to a family member.\nForough is one of the few women to join Afghanistan\u2019s emerging technology sector. Her coding school trains 50 girls and teaches elementary web design, along with mobile app development. She believes that her school \u2013 a recipient of the Google Rise Award for nonprofits promoting computer science education \u2013 makes her students self-reliant, upgrades their status in society and broadens their perspectives because it gives them access to the rest of the world.\n\u201cThese women have better chances to find jobs based on their skills,\u201d Forough said. \u201cAs women earn income and support their families, their communities will gradually realize the value of working women. The man who abuses his wife or daughter at home may begin to see and treat her differently.\u201d\nIn a country where only a few years ago the internet, television and even music were banned, many see the growing number of women in technology as a hopeful sign of progress.\n\u201cTechnology provides women with a unique opportunity to learn, work and have sustainable livelihoods, regardless of geographical location, age or gender,\u201d says Omar Mansoor Ansari, president of TechNation, an I.T. services firm in Kabul. \u201cThis is what women in Afghanistan are gradually realizing, and more and more girls are joining tech.\u201d\nNot only does a career in computers offer Afghan women financial independence, it also gives them the chance to work from home. That\u2019s a key reason many women are attracted to the tech field and, crucially, why many families support their daughters\u2019 involvement with it.\nAround the country, companies and institutions are recognizing the benefits of helping women get into tech. TechNation provides a number of programs to teach women coding and expand their entrepreneurial capabilities. One of the firm\u2019s initiatives isTechWomen Afghanistan, a network of 150 members that regularly organizes coding workshops and events. Each year, more than 100 young women aged 12\u201318 participate in Technovation Afghanistan,a global challenge in which contestants create mobile phone apps and learn how to launch startups.\u00a0And TechDera, a community technology center based in Kabul, provides women with training in mobile app design, web development and Java programming.\nFor many Afghan women, technology has transformed their lives. As a programmer, TechNation communications assistant Shakiba Ibrahimkhail has the freedom to choose where and when she wants to work, and the types of projects she wants to work on. \u201cCoding can help me be my own boss,\u201d she says.\nForough wants to help more women feel that way. Her plan for CTI in the next year is to enroll more students, expand to other cities and continue developing mobile apps for education and games, for providing health tips and raising awareness about women\u2019s issues in the country.\n\u201cSometimes as an outsider, it can be scary to think about programming and coding as potential careers,\u201d Forough said when asked for her advice to girls who want to learn to code. \u201cBut don\u2019t be afraid of challenges. They make you stronger and give you perspective in life. And once you learn, you will see how coding is so empowering.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared on\u00a0Women & Girls Hub.
