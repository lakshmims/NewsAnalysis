Mainland European equity markets took the brunt of selling as investors feared the vote could destabilize the 28-member bloc by prompting more referendums.\nThe traditional safe-harbor assets of top-rated government debt, the Japanese yen and gold all jumped. Spot gold rose nearly 4 percent and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to a low of 1.406 percent, last seen in 2012, though it climbed higher in afternoon trading.\nStocks tumbled in Europe. Frankfurt and Paris each fell 7 percent to 8 percent. Italian and Spanish markets posted their sharpest one-day drops ever, falling more than 12 percent, led by a dive in European bank stocks. Italy's Unicredit fell 24 percent while Spain's Banco Santander fell 20 percent.\nLondon's FTSE dropped 3.2 percent, with some investors speculating that the plunge in sterling could benefit Britain's economy. The index closed up 2 percent for the week for its best weekly gain in over two months.\n\"I think markets were really caught off guard today, that's why you are seeing a huge risk-off trade,\" said Jeff Kravetz, a strategist at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. \"In the end, when markets start to settle down, I think they are going to realize that this is not the end of the world.\"\nStill, Britain's big banks took a $100 billion battering, with Lloyds, Barclays \u00a0and RBS plunging as much as 30 percent, although they cut those losses nearly in half later in the day.\nStocks on Wall Street traded down more than 3 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping as much as 655 points, its worst daily drop in 10 months.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 611.21 points, or 3.39 percent, to 17,399.86, the S&P 500 lost 76.02 points, or 3.6 percent, to 2,037.3 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 202.06 points, or 4.12 percent, to 4,707.98.\nMSCI's all-country world stock index fell 4.8 percent.\nVoting results showed a 51.9/48.1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two.\nThe British pound dived by 18 U.S. cents at one point, to its lowest since 1985. The euro slid 3 percent to $1.1050 as investors feared for its very future.\nSterling was last down 8.3 percent at $1.3642 , having carved out a range of $1.3228 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye.\nThe Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People's Bank of China all said they were ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure global market stability.\nSHOCKWAVES\nThe shockwaves affected all asset classes and regions.\nThe safe-haven yen jumped 3.8 percent to 102.36 per dollar, having been as low as 106.81. The dollar's peak decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998.\nEmerging market currencies across Asia and eastern Europe and South Africa's rand all buckled on fears that investors could pull out. Poland's zloty slumped 4.7 percent.\nEurope's safety play, the 10-year German government bond, surged, with yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid almost 3.4 percent. Tokyo's Nikkei had its worst fall since 2011, down 7.9 percent.\nInvestors stampeded into low-risk sovereign bonds, with U.S. 10-year notes up around 1.5 points in price to yield 1.5718 percent. Earlier, the yield dipped to 1.406 percent.\nThe rally even extended to UK bonds, despite a warning from ratings agency Standard & Poor's that it was likely to downgrade Britain's triple-A credit rating if it left the EU. Yields on benchmark 10-year gilts fell 27 basis points to 1.096 pct .\nAcross the Atlantic, investors were pricing in less chance of another hike in U.S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.\nThe cost for Wall Street to fund dollar-based trades rose on Friday to the highest in nearly three months.\nOil prices slumped around 5 percent amid fears of a broader economic slowdown that could reduce demand. U.S. crude shed $2.51 to $47.60 a barrel while Brent fell 4.9 percent to $48.42.\nIndustrial metal copper sank 1.7 percent but gold leaped nearly 5 percent higher thanks to its perceived safe-haven status.\n\u00a0\n(Additional reporting by Sadiq Iqbal Ahmed, Caroline Valetkevitch, Olivia Oran and David Henery in New York Editing by Nick Zieminski and Dan Grebler)", "title": "Markets Tumble Amid Brexit Chaos"}
