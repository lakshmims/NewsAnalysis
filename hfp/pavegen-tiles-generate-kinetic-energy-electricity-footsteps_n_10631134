Basically, if you walk on one, your step can help light soccer fields in Brazil and Nigeria, a hallway in Heathrow Airport or offices and shopping centers in London -- all locations where these tiles have been installed.The latest version of the tiles also come in a triangular shape, with a generator in each corner, which maximizes energy output no matter where you step.Yet the tiles, which have been endorsed by Al Gore,\u00a0only generate about 5 watts of continuous power, which isn\u2019t very much. But the more footsteps you get, the larger the output.\nFor instance, when Killian Fox from The Guardian visited Pavegen\u2019s offices, and jumped on demo tiles with CEO Laurence Kemball-Cook, the pair created enough energy to turn on a radio. Or in a case in Lagos, Nigeria, where the tiles were installed under a soccer field, and players lit up the entire field during a match:Kemball-Cook has acknowledged the technology has its limitations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make Pavegen the sole energy source to power every city in the future,\u201d he told Radio France Internationale. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s going to be one of the key constituents of the energy mix of the future.\u201d\nDavid Horsley, a mechanical and aerospace engineer at UC Davis, told Wired that the tiles could have a place in our everyday lives.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get very much for a step, considering you can get 100 watts from a square meter of solar paneling,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut for small wearable electronics like watches, or maybe even your phone, this kind of energy harvesting makes sense.\u201d", "title": "Tiles That Generate Energy When People Walk Over Them Are Totally Lit"}
