Police have said the gunman was armed with an assault-rifle-type weapon and a handgun that were purchased legally.\nThe president said he was concerned that the response to the massacre would turn into a debate over whether to toughen gun laws or pursue extremist groups like Islamic State.\n\"We have to go after these terrorist organizations and hit them hard,\" Obama said. \"But we also have to make sure that it is not easy for somebody who decides they want to harm people in this country to be able to obtain weapons.\"\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner and Alana Wise; Editing by Toni Reinhold)", "title": "Obama: No Evidence Orlando Shooter Was Directed By Larger Terrorist Network"}
