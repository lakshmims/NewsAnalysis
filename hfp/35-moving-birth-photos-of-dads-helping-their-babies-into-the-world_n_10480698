From massaging an exhausted mother-to-be's back, to reminding her of her strength when she is at her most vulnerable, a supportive partner can make an enormous difference in labor and delivery.\nSo in honor of Father's Day, we asked the\u00a0International Association of Professional Birth Photographers\u00a0for photos that capture the important emotional and physical support dads-to-be provide their partners, as well as the utter magic of fathers meeting their babies for the first time.\u00a0Here are 35 of them, with captions from the photographers.\n(Note: Since the photographs below depict women in various stages of childbirth, some may not be suitable for viewing in all situations.)* Captions have been edited and condensed for length and clarity.\u00a0", "title": "35 Raw Birth Photos Of Dads Welcoming Their Babies Into The World"}
