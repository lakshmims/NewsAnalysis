He said it in May. He said it February. He said it last August. But it is not true at all.\u00a0\nWhen it comes to its tax rates, the U.S. ranks 17th, 19th or 31st among the world's 33 developed nations depending on what metric you use, as Politifact has doggedly noted each time Trump has wheeled out this lie.Politifact also looked at numbers from the World Bank, which \"placed the United States near the bottom in tax revenue as a percentage of GDP.\" Another report from the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers includes things like property and business profits, and it determined the U.S. ranked 64th out of 189 countries in total tax rate.\u00a0\nThere's just no way to slice the numbers to make Trump's statement anything less than totally untrue. The simple fact is that the U.S. tax rate is near the middle or bottom compared to other countries.\u00a0\nEditor's note:\u00a0Donald Trump regularly\u00a0incites political violence\u00a0and is a\u00a0serial liar,\u00a0rampant xenophobe,\u00a0racist,\u00a0misogynist\u00a0and\u00a0birther\u00a0who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.", "title": "Donald Trump Keeps Calling The U.S. The \u2018Highest Taxed Nation.\u2019 It\u2019s Not Even Close."}
