I think it depends on the day, for everybody,\" the 49-year-old told InStyle UK. \"There\u2019s some days you say, 'This is it,' and you love it. Then there are days when you go, 'This can not be it! Is this really it?' So I think it\u2019s up and down all the time!\"\nHayek, who turns 50 later this year, hints that being in show business doesn't help when it comes to the pressure to look a certain way.\n\"The amount of pressure on women now, it\u2019s crazy,\" she told The Guardian last year. \"You have to be much better than your male colleagues ... you still have to be a good wife and mother. And now you also have to be skinny, and you have to look 20 when you\u2019re 40. It\u2019s too much. We need to stop with the crazy expectations, give ourselves a break.\u201d\nSandra Bullock, who turned 50 in 2014, shared Hayek's candid view when it comes to aging, saying her 50s might not be the \"best\" time of her life but it still \"feels good.\"\nHayek says she's never considered getting any cosmetic treatments like Botox to try to look younger -- in fact, she's said that being told to go under the needle was one of the worst pieces of advice she ever got.\u00a0\nYou're gorgeous just the way you are, Salma.\u00a0\n\u00a0", "title": "Salma Hayek Gets Candid About Body Confidence In Middle Age"}
