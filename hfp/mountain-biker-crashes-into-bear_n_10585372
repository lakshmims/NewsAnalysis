Souza recorded the collision on his helmet camera, as seen in the video below.\n\"Yeah,\" Souza says in between moans of pain. \"That was a bear.\"By the time Souza got back up on his feet, his friends had caught up to him on the trail. The bear, however, disappeared into the woods.\n\"This bear came out of nowhere and was gone before I could ask if it was all right,\" Souza explained on an Instagram post.\nSouza took a screen grab of the video after the crash and brightened the shadows to show his friends the true horror of his beary scary clash.\n\"Unfortunately this bear wanted to test my reflexes,\" he wrote in a separate post.", "title": "Video Of Mountain Biker's Wild Ride Will Terrify You"}
