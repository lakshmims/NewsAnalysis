Luckily, Wright, Penn's now ex-wife, was having none of it.\u00a0\n\"But my mom was never going to go for it,\" Hopper said. \"What they told me is that I hopped in her stomach, I didn't kick, so they went with that.\"\u00a0\nThough if Hopper was named Steak, we bet he'd get along with Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin's daughter, Apple.\u00a0\nThe 22-year-old is now an actor and has been in the business for about two-and-a-half years. He got his start after asking his famous father if he could PA on his dad's next movie.\u00a0\n\"He said, 'No, you're going to act in it,'\" Hopper told Interview. \"I said no, because I'm very shy; I didn't know how to act. He said, 'Well, you'll get paid.' So I was like, 'I'm onboard.' After the first day, I fell in love with it.\"\u00a0\nLook for Hopper in Brad Pitt's upcoming Netflix flick, \"War Machine.\"", "title": "Sean Penn Wanted To Give His Son Hopper A Truly Rare First Name"}
