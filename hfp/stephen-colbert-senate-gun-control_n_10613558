(How wrong he was to think they might listen to the wishes of 90 percent of the population.)\nNeedless to say, Colbert's over it.\u00a0\n\"Hey, Senate, my dog accomplished more than you this week when he rolled over and licked his nuts.\"", "title": "Stephen Colbert Tells The Senate What's What After Gun Control BS"}
