And yesterday an employee wrote the word \u2018fatty\u2019 on their check,\u201d Ambrosio said.\nAmbrosio is very familiar with the employee who handled the order: It's his 18-year-old son, T.J.\nArnold posted a photo of the offensive receipt to Facebook where it quickly went viral.\nBoth Ambrosios attempted to apologize via the Facebook post.\nAntonio Ambrosio wrote:\u00a0\n\n\"We sincerely apologize for your negative experience last night. It was very unprofessional to say the least. We take full accountability for what occurred and would like to make it up to you. Please call me so I can offer you something for the inconvenience. This should not have happened and my staff will be dealt with right away.\"\n\nAmbrosio also fired his son and said the teen is also forbidden to eat at the restaurant.\nT.J. did reach out to Arnold on social media to apologize, according to the New York Daily News:\n\n\u201cWhat I did was immature and I acted without thinking about the consequences. I acted in a way that was rude, childish, and totally inappropriate. Due to my actions, I was terminated, rightly so,\u201d he said.\nAmbrosio has also offered a $50 gift card in an attempt to entice Arnold back to the restaurant.\nSo far, Arnold's not biting.\n\"I'd rather just not go there,\" Arnold told WJAR-TV. \"It's just so embarrassing.\"", "title": "Restaurant Customer Has Beef Over Being Called 'Fatty' On Receipt"}
