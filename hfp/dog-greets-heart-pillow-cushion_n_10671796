Then she rolls onto her back for her belly to be tickled. After which she follows you around sneezing ... she sneezes when she is excited, it\u2019s a bit weird, but adds to the cute appeal.\u201dHe and his wife never trained Gypsy specifically to bring them the heart pillow, and the pooch made similar gestures with toys and shoes even before they bought the cushion.\n\u201cI know she doesn't know that the heart symbolises love, but its still extremely cute,\u201d northernbloke said. \u201cObviously our reactions to her bringing the cushion has re-enforced that it is a good thing, therefore she repeats it to get praise.\u201d\nGypsy, you sure know how to win a person over.", "title": "Sweet Dog Greets Family With Heart-Shaped Cushion Every Day"}
